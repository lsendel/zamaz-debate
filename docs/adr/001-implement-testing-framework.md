# ADR-001: Implement Comprehensive Testing Framework

## Status
Accepted (Implemented in PR #69)

## Context
The Zamaz Debate System had evolved through 86 iterations without a formal testing framework. This created several risks:
- No validation that features work as intended
- Difficult to refactor without breaking existing functionality
- No safety net for future evolutions
- Impossible to measure code quality objectively

## Decision
We implemented a comprehensive testing framework using pytest with the following components:
1. Test configuration with fixtures for mocking external dependencies
2. Unit tests for core components (DebateNucleus, EvolutionTracker, PRService)
3. Integration tests for Web API endpoints
4. Mock implementations of AI clients to enable testing without API costs

## Consequences

### Positive
- All future changes can be validated against tests
- Refactoring is now safer with test coverage
- CI/CD pipeline can run tests automatically
- Documentation through test examples
- Reduced debugging time

### Negative
- Additional maintenance burden for tests
- Slightly slower development for new features (need to write tests)
- Initial time investment to create the framework

### Neutral
- Tests require updates when interfaces change
- Team needs to adopt test-driven development practices

## Implementation Details
- Test framework: pytest with asyncio support
- Mocking strategy: Mock AI clients to avoid API costs
- Coverage: 34 tests across all major components
- Location: `/tests/` directory
