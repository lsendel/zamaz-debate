# ADR-000: Use Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

## Status
Accepted

## Context
After 86 evolutions focused heavily on features (85) and performance optimizations (recent 5), the system lacks documented architectural decisions. This has led to:
- No clear rationale for design choices
- Repeated optimization attempts without understanding the architecture
- Risk of contradictory design decisions
- Knowledge silos as the system evolves

Both Claude and Gemini agreed in the debate that introducing ADRs is the most critical improvement needed before further optimizations.

## Decision
We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant architectural decisions. ADRs will:
- Follow a lightweight template (this document serves as the template)
- Be stored in `/docs/adr/` directory
- Be numbered sequentially (000, 001, 002...)
- Be written in Markdown for easy version control
- Be created for any decision that affects the system's architecture

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear documentation of architectural decisions and their rationale
- Better team communication and knowledge sharing
- Historical context for future decisions
- Reduced risk of repeating past mistakes
- Foundation for informed performance optimizations

### Negative
- Additional overhead in the development process
- Requires discipline to maintain
- Risk of over-documentation if not kept lightweight

### Neutral
- Requires team buy-in and training
- Must be integrated into the development workflow

## Template Structure
Each ADR should contain:
1. **Title**: ADR-NNN: Brief description
2. **Status**: Proposed/Accepted/Deprecated/Superseded
3. **Context**: Why this decision is needed
4. **Decision**: What we're doing
5. **Consequences**: Positive, negative, and neutral impacts
6. **Implementation Details**: (Optional) Technical specifics
