# Orchestration Workflow Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the implementation plan for creating an advanced orchestration workflow system for debates in the Zamaz Debate System. The proposed solution combines workflow orchestration with low-cost LLM orchestration to achieve cost optimization, scalability, and intelligent decision-making.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Architecture
- **DebateNucleus**: Simple two-round debate mechanism
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Well-structured bounded contexts
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Event bus for cross-context communication
- **AI Client Factory**: Multi-provider support with fallback mechanisms
- **Task Processing**: Basic GitHub app task processing

### Limitations
- Fixed debate structure (2 rounds maximum)
- No dynamic participant management
- Limited orchestration complexity
- High API costs for orchestration decisions
- No intelligent workflow adaptation

## Proposed Architecture

### Hybrid Orchestration Approach

We propose a **hybrid architecture** that combines:
1. **Workflow Orchestration**: State machine-based debate orchestration
2. **LLM Orchestration**: Low-cost LLM for intelligent orchestration decisions

## Implementation Phases

- WorkflowStep abstract base class
- WorkflowEngine for execution
- Integration with DDD contexts
```

**Features**:
- State machine-based workflow execution

**Example Structure**:
```yaml
name: "Complex Architectural Debate"
description: "Multi-round debate for complex architectural decisions"
participants:
  - claude-opus-4

```python
class DebateWorkflow:
    def __init__(self, definition: WorkflowDefinition):
        self.definition = definition
        self.state = WorkflowState.INITIALIZED
        self.current_step = 0
        self.context = {}
        self.participants = []
        
    async def execute(self) -> WorkflowResult:
        """Execute the workflow from current state"""
        
    async def pause(self) -> None:
        """Pause workflow execution"""
        
    async def resume(self) -> None:
        """Resume paused workflow"""
        
    async def abort(self) -> None:
        """Abort workflow execution"""
```

#### 2. LLM Orchestrator

```python
class LLMOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self, config: OrchestrationConfig):
        self.ollama_client = OllamaClient()
        self.grok_client = GrokClient()
        self.config = config
        
    async def make_orchestration_decision(
        self, 
        context: DebateContext
    ) -> OrchestrationDecision:
        """Make intelligent orchestration decisions"""
        
    async def detect_consensus(
        self, 
        debate_state: DebateState
    ) -> ConsensusResult:
        """Detect if consensus has been reached"""
        
    async def select_workflow(
        self, 
        question: str, 
        complexity: str
    ) -> WorkflowDefinition:
        """Select appropriate workflow based on context"""
```

### Integration Points
