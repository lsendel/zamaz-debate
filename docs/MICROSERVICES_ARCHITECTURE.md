# Microservices Architecture Plan for Zamaz Debate System

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a plan to transition the Zamaz Debate System from its current monolithic architecture to a microservices-based architecture. The transition will be gradual, focusing on high-value services first while maintaining system stability.

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Monolithic Components
- **DebateNucleus**: Core orchestration logic
- **Web Interface**: FastAPI application serving all endpoints
- **File Storage**: JSON-based persistence
- **AI Clients**: Direct integration with Claude and Gemini
- **Event System**: In-process event bus

### Pain Points
1. **Scalability**: Cannot scale individual components independently
2. **Deployment**: Changes require full system deployment
3. **Fault Isolation**: One component failure affects entire system
4. **Technology Lock-in**: Difficult to use different technologies for different components
5. **Team Scaling**: Hard for multiple teams to work independently

## Data Architecture

### Databases

#### PostgreSQL Clusters
1. **Debate Database**
   - Debates table
   - Rounds table
   - Arguments table
   - Consensus table

2. **Decision Database**
   - Decisions table
   - Implementations table
   - Pull_requests table
   - Issues table

3. **Workflow Database**
   - Workflows table
   - Workflow_executions table
   - Workflow_states table

#### Redis Clusters
- Session management
- Caching layer
- Real-time data

#### S3/Object Storage
- Large debate transcripts
- File attachments
- Backups

## Communication Patterns

### Synchronous Communication
- REST APIs for client-facing operations
- gRPC for internal service communication

### Asynchronous Communication
- Kafka for event streaming
- Event patterns:
  - DebateRequested → Debate Service
  - DebateStarted → Multiple consumers
  - ConsensusReached → Decision Service
  - ImplementationRequired → Implementation Tracker

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Month 1-2)
1. Set up Kafka event bus
2. Implement event publishing in monolith
3. Create PostgreSQL schemas
4. Set up API Gateway

### Phase 2: Extract Read Services (Month 2-3)
1. Extract Consensus Analysis Service
2. Create read-only APIs
3. Implement caching layer
4. Gradual traffic migration

### Phase 3: Extract Core Services (Month 3-4)
1. Extract AI Gateway Service
2. Extract Decision Management Service
3. Implement service discovery
4. Set up monitoring

### Phase 4: Extract Complex Services (Month 4-5)
1. Extract Debate Service
2. Extract Workflow Engine
3. Implement distributed transactions
4. Complete data migration

### Phase 5: UI and Polish (Month 5-6)
1. Rebuild UI as separate service
2. Implement WebSocket for real-time
3. Performance optimization
4. Documentation

## Infrastructure Requirements

### Container Orchestration
- **Kubernetes** for container management
- **Helm** charts for deployment

### Service Mesh
- **Istio** for:
  - Traffic management
  - Security policies
  - Observability

### CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions for each service
- Automated testing
- Blue-green deployments

### Monitoring Stack
- **Prometheus** for metrics
- **Grafana** for visualization
- **Jaeger** for distributed tracing
- **ELK Stack** for centralized logging

## Security Considerations

1. **Service-to-Service Authentication**: mTLS
2. **API Authentication**: OAuth 2.0/JWT
3. **Secrets Management**: HashiCorp Vault
4. **Network Policies**: Zero-trust approach
5. **Data Encryption**: At rest and in transit

## Cost Implications

### Infrastructure Costs (Monthly Estimate)
- Kubernetes Cluster: $500-1000
- Databases: $300-500
- Kafka Cluster: $200-400
- Monitoring: $100-200
- Object Storage: $50-100
- **Total**: $1150-2200/month

### Development Costs
- 6-month timeline
- 3-5 developers
- DevOps engineer
- Part-time architect

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Strangler Fig Pattern**: Gradually replace monolith
2. **Feature Flags**: Control rollout
3. **Canary Deployments**: Test with subset of traffic
4. **Rollback Strategy**: Quick reversion capability
5. **Data Consistency**: Implement saga pattern

## Success Metrics

1. **Performance**
   - Response time < 200ms (p95)
   - 99.9% uptime
   - Horizontal scaling capability

2. **Development Velocity**
