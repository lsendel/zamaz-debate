# Integration Test Plan for Cross-Context Communication

## Overview

This plan outlines the strategy for testing cross-context communication in the DDD architecture, ensuring that bounded contexts can communicate effectively through domain events while maintaining loose coupling.

## Test Strategy

### 1. Event Bus Infrastructure
Before testing cross-context communication, we need an event bus to facilitate event publishing and subscription.

**Components to test:**
- Event publishing mechanism
- Event subscription and routing
- Event handler execution
- Error handling and resilience

### 2. Cross-Context Communication Flows

#### Flow 1: Debate → Implementation
**Scenario**: When a debate completes with a complex decision, create implementation tasks

**Test Cases**:
1. Complex debate completion triggers task creation
2. Debate winner assignment flows to task assignee
3. Debate decision details populate task description
4. Multiple implementation tasks from single debate

**Events**: 
- `DebateCompleted` → `ImplementationRequested` → `TaskCreated`

#### Flow 2: Evolution → All Contexts
**Scenario**: System evolution triggers improvements across all contexts

**Test Cases**:
1. Evolution analysis examines all contexts
2. Improvements create tasks in Implementation
3. Performance improvements trigger benchmark updates
4. Testing improvements update test suites
5. Evolution completion updates all affected contexts

**Events**:
- `EvolutionTriggered` → Context analysis events
- `ImprovementSuggested` → Context-specific improvement events
- `EvolutionCompleted` → Update events for each context

#### Flow 3: Testing → Performance
**Scenario**: Test failures trigger performance analysis

**Test Cases**:
1. Performance test failure triggers metric collection
2. Coverage decrease triggers optimization suggestion
3. Flaky tests trigger reliability analysis
4. Test suite completion updates performance baselines

**Events**:
- `TestFailed` → `PerformanceAnalysisRequested`
- `CoverageDecreased` → `OptimizationSuggested`
- `TestSuiteCompleted` → `BenchmarkTriggered`

#### Flow 4: Implementation → Evolution
**Scenario**: Implementation metrics feed back to evolution

**Test Cases**:
1. Deployment failures trigger evolution analysis
2. Task completion rates influence evolution priorities
3. PR rejection patterns suggest improvements
4. Deployment success validates evolution effectiveness

**Events**:
- `DeploymentFailed` → `EvolutionAnalysisRequested`
- `TaskMetricsCollected` → `EvolutionPriorityUpdated`
- `PullRequestMerged` → `EvolutionValidated`

#### Flow 5: Performance → Implementation
**Scenario**: Performance issues create optimization tasks

**Test Cases**:
1. Metric threshold breach creates high-priority task
2. Benchmark regression triggers rollback task
3. Optimization success creates deployment task
4. Performance alert creates investigation task

**Events**:
- `MetricThresholdBreached` → `TaskCreated` (high priority)
- `BenchmarkRegression` → `RollbackRequested`
- `OptimizationCompleted` → `DeploymentRequested`

### 3. Integration Patterns

#### Saga Pattern Tests
**Long-running processes spanning multiple contexts**

1. **Evolution Saga**:
   - Trigger → Analysis → Planning → Implementation → Validation
   - Test compensation on failure
   - Test state persistence across restarts

2. **Deployment Saga**:
   - PR Merge → Tests → Build → Deploy → Validate
   - Test rollback on failure
   - Test parallel deployments

#### Event Sourcing Tests
**Verify event stream integrity**

1. Event ordering and consistency
2. Event replay capability
3. Snapshot generation
4. Event versioning compatibility

### 4. Non-Functional Tests

#### Performance Tests
1. Event throughput (events/second)
2. Event processing latency
3. Memory usage under high event load
4. Event storage growth rate

#### Resilience Tests
1. Context isolation (one context failure doesn't affect others)
2. Event delivery guarantees
3. Duplicate event handling
4. Out-of-order event handling

#### Security Tests
1. Event authorization (contexts can only publish allowed events)
2. Event data validation
3. Sensitive data handling in events

## Test Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Infrastructure (Week 1)
1. Implement event bus with in-memory and persistent options
2. Create test harness for event verification
3. Implement event recording for test assertions
4. Create mock event publishers/subscribers

### Phase 2: Basic Flows (Week 2)
1. Implement simplest cross-context flows
2. Test happy path scenarios
3. Verify event data transformation
4. Test basic error handling

### Phase 3: Complex Flows (Week 3)
1. Implement saga patterns
2. Test failure scenarios and compensation
3. Test concurrent event processing
4. Implement performance benchmarks

### Phase 4: End-to-End Scenarios (Week 4)
1. Full system workflows
2. Chaos testing
3. Load testing
4. Documentation and examples

## Test Data Management

### Event Fixtures
```python
# Standard test events for each context
debate_completed_event = DebateCompleted(
    debate_id=UUID("..."),
    topic="Test Decision",
    winner="Claude",
    consensus=True,
    decision_type="COMPLEX"
)

evolution_triggered_event = EvolutionTriggered(
    evolution_id=UUID("..."),
    trigger_type="PERFORMANCE",
    current_metrics={...}
)
```

### Context State Setup
```python
# Helpers to set up context state
async def setup_debate_context(completed_debates=5, active_debates=2):
    # Create test data
    pass

async def setup_evolution_context(past_evolutions=3, current_metrics=None):
    # Create test data
    pass
```

## Success Criteria

### Functional Criteria
- [ ] All defined event flows execute successfully
- [ ] Events contain all required data
- [ ] No context directly calls another context
- [ ] Event handlers are idempotent
- [ ] Failed events can be retried

### Performance Criteria
- [ ] Event processing < 100ms for 95% of events
- [ ] System handles 1000 events/second
- [ ] Memory usage stable under load
- [ ] No event loss under normal conditions

### Quality Criteria
- [ ] 90% code coverage for event handlers
- [ ] All events documented
- [ ] Integration test suite runs in < 5 minutes
- [ ] Clear error messages for failures

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Event Storm**: Rate limiting and backpressure
2. **Circular Dependencies**: Event flow analysis tools
3. **Data Consistency**: Eventual consistency patterns
4. **Performance Degradation**: Monitoring and alerts

### Process Risks
1. **Test Complexity**: Start simple, iterate
2. **Flaky Tests**: Proper test isolation
3. **Long Test Runtime**: Parallel execution
4. **Maintenance Burden**: Good test organization

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics to Track
- Event processing rate
- Event processing latency
- Failed event count
- Event retry count
- Context health status

### Debugging Tools
- Event flow visualization
- Event replay capability
- Context state inspection
- Performance profiling

## Conclusion

This integration test plan ensures that the DDD architecture's cross-context communication is robust, performant, and maintainable. The phased approach allows for incremental validation while building toward comprehensive system testing.
