# Domain-Driven Design Implementation Summary

## Overview

The Zamaz Debate System implements Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles to organize its architecture around business domains and bounded contexts. This document summarizes the current DDD implementation and its strategic design decisions.

## Domain Model Structure

### Core Domain: Debate System

The core domain represents the heart of the application - facilitating AI debates for decision-making.

#### Entities
- **Decision**: Represents a decision to be made through the debate system
  - Identity: Unique ID
  - Properties: content, complexity, type, status, timestamp
  - Business Rules: Complexity determines debate necessity

- **Debate**: Represents a debate between AI agents
  - Identity: Unique ID
  - Properties: decision_id, participants, exchanges, outcome
  - Business Rules: Must have at least two participants

- **PullRequest**: Represents a GitHub pull request created from decisions
  - Identity: PR number
  - Properties: decision_id, pr_number, status, branch_name
  - Business Rules: Only created for COMPLEX and EVOLUTION decisions

#### Value Objects
- **DecisionType**: Enum (SIMPLE, MODERATE, COMPLEX, EVOLUTION)
- **ComplexityLevel**: Enum (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)
- **PRStatus**: Enum (OPEN, CLOSED, MERGED)
- **ImplementationAssignee**: Enum (CLAUDE, GEMINI, CODEX)
- **DebateParticipant**: Represents an AI participant in a debate
- **DebateExchange**: Represents a single exchange in a debate

#### Aggregates
- **Decision Aggregate**: Decision is the aggregate root
  - Can have associated Debate (for complex decisions)
  - Can have associated PullRequest (for complex/evolution decisions)
  - Ensures consistency of decision lifecycle

## Bounded Contexts

### 1. Decision Context
**Purpose**: Manages decision-making process and complexity assessment

**Components**:
- `domain/models.py`: Domain entities and value objects
- `src/core/nucleus.py`: Decision orchestration and complexity assessment
- `src/services/complexity_analyzer.py`: Complexity determination logic

**Responsibilities**:
- Assess decision complexity
- Route decisions to appropriate handling (simple vs debate)
- Maintain decision history

### 2. Debate Context
**Purpose**: Orchestrates AI debates between Claude and Gemini

**Components**:
- `src/services/debate_service.py`: Debate orchestration
- `src/services/ai_client_factory.py`: AI provider abstraction
- Domain models for Debate, DebateParticipant, DebateExchange

**Responsibilities**:
- Facilitate structured debates
- Manage debate participants
- Capture debate outcomes

### 3. Integration Context
**Purpose**: Handles external system integrations (GitHub, webhooks)

**Components**:
- `src/services/pr_service.py`: GitHub PR/issue creation
- `src/webhooks/`: Webhook notification system
- `src/services/evolution_service.py`: System self-improvement

**Responsibilities**:
- Create GitHub pull requests and issues
- Send webhook notifications
- Manage external integrations

### 4. Web Context
**Purpose**: Provides HTTP API and web interface

**Components**:
- `src/web/app.py`: FastAPI application
- `src/web/static/`: Web UI assets
- API endpoints for decision submission

**Responsibilities**:
- HTTP request handling
- API endpoint management
- Static file serving

## Implementation Details

### 5. Event Storming Implementation (`/docs/event-storming.md`)
- **50+ Domain Events** mapped across bounded contexts
- **Event Flows** for decision making, implementation, evolution
- **Integration Patterns** including anti-corruption layers
- **Command-Event Mapping** for workflow traceability

### 6. Extended Contexts (`/src/contexts/`)
The implementation includes foundations for additional contexts:
- **Implementation Context** - For managing code implementation
- **Evolution Context** - For system self-improvement  
- **AI Integration Context** - For AI provider management
- **Testing Context** - For test automation
- **Performance Context** - For performance monitoring

## Domain Services

### Core Services
1. **DebateNucleus**: Main orchestration service
   - Coordinates between contexts
   - Implements decision routing logic
   - Manages persistence

2. **ComplexityAnalyzer**: Determines decision complexity
   - Analyzes decision content
   - Applies business rules for complexity levels
   - Routes to appropriate handling

3. **DebateService**: Orchestrates AI debates
   - Manages debate lifecycle
   - Coordinates AI participants
   - Captures debate outcomes

4. **PRService**: GitHub integration service
   - Creates pull requests for complex decisions
   - Creates implementation issues
   - Manages GitHub API interactions

## Repository Pattern

### Current Implementation
- **File-based persistence**: JSON files for debates and evolution history
- **Repository interfaces**: Implicit through service layer
- **Data access**: Direct file I/O in services

### Repository Responsibilities
- Store and retrieve debates
- Maintain evolution history
- Persist decision outcomes

## Domain Events

### Event Types
1. **DecisionCreated**: New decision submitted
2. **DebateStarted**: Debate initiated for complex decision
3. **DebateCompleted**: Debate concluded with outcome
4. **PullRequestCreated**: PR created for decision
5. **EvolutionTriggered**: System evolution initiated

### Event Handling
- Webhook system publishes events to external subscribers
- Internal event handling through service coordination

## Anti-Corruption Layer

### AI Provider Abstraction
- `AIClientFactory`: Abstracts AI provider differences
- Supports multiple providers (Claude, Gemini)
- Mock implementations for testing

### Benefits
- Protects domain from external API changes
- Enables provider switching
- Facilitates testing without API calls

## Ubiquitous Language

### Key Terms
- **Decision**: A question or task requiring AI analysis
- **Debate**: Structured discussion between AI agents
- **Complexity**: Measure of decision difficulty (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)
- **Evolution**: System self-improvement process
- **Nucleus**: Core orchestration component
- **Exchange**: Single round of debate between participants


## DDD Patterns Applied

### 1. Strategic Design
- **Bounded Contexts**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Context Mapping**: Integration context bridges domains
- **Ubiquitous Language**: Consistent terminology

### 2. Tactical Design
- **Entities**: Decision, Debate, PullRequest
- **Value Objects**: Enums and immutable data
- **Aggregates**: Decision as aggregate root
- **Domain Services**: Business logic encapsulation
- **Repository Pattern**: Persistence abstraction

### 3. Supporting Patterns
- **Factory Pattern**: AIClientFactory
- **Anti-Corruption Layer**: AI provider abstraction
- **Domain Events**: Webhook notifications

## Benefits Realized

1. **Clear Architecture**: Bounded contexts provide clear separation
2. **Business Focus**: Domain models reflect business concepts
3. **Flexibility**: Easy to extend with new contexts
4. **Testability**: Domain logic isolated from infrastructure
5. **Maintainability**: Clear responsibilities and boundaries

## Areas for Enhancement

1. **Event Sourcing**: Could capture all state changes as events
2. **CQRS**: Separate read/write models for optimization
3. **Domain Event Bus**: Internal event routing system
4. **Repository Interfaces**: Explicit repository contracts
5. **Saga Pattern**: For complex multi-step workflows


## Conclusion

The Zamaz Debate System successfully implements core DDD principles, providing a clean architecture organized around business domains. The bounded contexts, domain models, and supporting patterns create a maintainable and extensible system that clearly reflects the business domain of AI-assisted decision-making.
