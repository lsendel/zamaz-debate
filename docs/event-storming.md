## Event Flows

### Decision Making Flow
```
DecisionRequested → ComplexityAssessed → [Simple Decision] → DecisionMade
                                     → [Complex Decision] → DebateInitiated → RoundStarted → ArgumentPresented → CounterArgumentGiven → RoundCompleted → ConsensusReached → DebateCompleted → DecisionMade
```

### Implementation Flow
```
DecisionMade → ImplementationRequested → TaskCreated → TaskAssigned → PullRequestDrafted → CodeReviewRequested → ReviewCompleted → PullRequestMerged → ImplementationCompleted
```

### Evolution Flow
```
EvolutionTriggered → PerformanceAnalyzed → ArchitectureAssessed → ImprovementSuggested → EvolutionPlanCreated → EvolutionApplied → EvolutionValidated → EvolutionCompleted
```

### Testing Flow
```
TestSuiteCreated → TestExecuted → [TestPassed|TestFailed] → TestSuiteCompleted → CoverageAnalyzed → TestReportGenerated
```

## Bounded Context Interactions

### Debate Context → Implementation Context
- **DecisionMade** triggers **ImplementationRequested**
- **ConsensusReached** triggers **TaskCreated**

### Implementation Context → Testing Context
- **PullRequestDrafted** triggers **TestSuiteCreated**
- **CodeReviewRequested** triggers **TestExecuted**

### Evolution Context → All Contexts
- **EvolutionTriggered** can trigger events in any context
- **ImprovementSuggested** can affect any bounded context

### AI Integration Context → All Contexts
- **AIResponseReceived** can trigger events in any context
- **ConversationStarted** can be triggered by any context

### Performance Context → Evolution Context
- **PerformanceThresholdExceeded** triggers **EvolutionTriggered**
- **OptimizationIdentified** triggers **ImprovementSuggested**

## Event Sourcing Considerations

Each event should contain:
- **EventId**: Unique identifier for the event
- **AggregateId**: Identifier of the aggregate that produced the event
- **EventType**: Type of the event
- **OccurredAt**: Timestamp when the event occurred
- **EventData**: Payload specific to the event type
- **Version**: Event version for schema evolution
- **CorrelationId**: To trace related events across contexts

## Integration Patterns

### Event Bus
All events will flow through a central event bus that:
- Ensures reliable delivery
- Provides event ordering guarantees
- Supports event replay capabilities
- Handles cross-context communication

### Anti-Corruption Layer
Each bounded context will have an anti-corruption layer to:
- Translate external events to internal domain events
- Protect domain model from external changes
- Maintain context autonomy

### Saga Pattern
For complex workflows spanning multiple contexts:
- **Decision Making Saga**: Orchestrates debate → decision → implementation
- **Evolution Saga**: Manages the complete evolution lifecycle
- **Quality Assurance Saga**: Coordinates testing and validation across contexts

## Command-Event Mapping

### Commands that Generate Events
- **StartDebate** command → **DebateInitiated** event
- **MakeDecision** command → **DecisionMade** event
- **CreateTask** command → **TaskCreated** event
- **TriggerEvolution** command → **EvolutionTriggered** event
- **RunTest** command → **TestExecuted** event

### Event Handlers
Each bounded context will have event handlers that:
- Process events from other contexts
- Update local aggregates
- Trigger local workflows
- Publish new events as needed

## Future Considerations

### Event Store
- Consider implementing an event store for audit trails
- Enable event replay for debugging and testing
- Support temporal queries for analytics

### Event Versioning
- Plan for event schema evolution
- Implement event upcasting for backward compatibility
- Consider event migration strategies

### Performance Optimization
- Implement event batching for high-volume scenarios
- Consider event compression for storage efficiency
- Plan for event archival and cleanup strategies
