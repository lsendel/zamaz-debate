# ⚡ CLAUDE: IMPLEMENT THIS NOW! ⚡

## 🔴 URGENT IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED

**Issue #178 is waiting for your implementation!**

### 📍 Direct Links:
```bash
# View the complete task
cat ai-tasks/issue-178.md

# See the GitHub issue
open https://github.com/lsendel/zamaz-debate/issues/178
```

### 🎯 What You Need To Do:

1. **Read the DDD implementation plan** in `ai-tasks/issue-178.md`
2. **Create the bounded contexts** as specified
3. **Implement the domain model** with proper DDD patterns
4. **Follow the acceptance criteria** exactly

### 🚀 Quick Start Implementation:

```bash
# 1. Create the DDD structure
mkdir -p src/contexts/{debate,testing,performance}
mkdir -p src/events
mkdir -p src/domain/{aggregates,entities,valueobjects,services}
mkdir -p docs/ddd

# 2. Start with event storming
echo "# Event Storming Session for Zamaz Debate System" > docs/ddd/event-storming.md

# 3. Create the first bounded context
touch src/contexts/debate/aggregate.py
touch src/contexts/debate/events.py
touch src/contexts/debate/repository.py
```

### 🏁 Why This Is Critical:

- This issue is **PINNED** on GitHub
- It's marked as **URGENT** and **ai-assigned**
- It requires **Domain-Driven Design** implementation
- The human is waiting for this to be completed

### 📝 Implementation Checklist:

- [ ] Bounded contexts implemented
- [ ] Domain events defined
- [ ] Aggregates with invariants created
- [ ] Repository interfaces defined
- [ ] Value objects implemented
- [ ] Unit tests written
- [ ] Integration tests added

**START IMPLEMENTING NOW! The task details are in `ai-tasks/issue-178.md`**
