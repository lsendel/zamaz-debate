Potential Problems & Risks with Continuing Feature Addition\n\n**Architectural Debt Accumulation**\n- Adding features on top of a v0.1.0 base without stabilization is extremely risky\n- The rapid addition of complex systems (caching, plugins, performance optimization) likely introduced integration issues\n- No evidence of consolidation or hardening phases\n\n**Testing Gap Crisis**\n- While a testing framework was added, there's no indication it's being used effectively\n- Each new feature exponentially increases the testing surface area\n- Performance optimization without comprehensive tests is particularly dangerous\n\n**Documentation Void**\n- 7 major features added with no mention of documentation updates\n- New developers (or even the original team) will struggle to understand the system\n- The plugin architecture especially needs extensive documentation\n\n### 2. Alternative Approaches to Consider\n\n**Option A: Comprehensive Refactoring Sprint**\n- Pause feature development entirely\n- Focus on consolidating the existing codebase\n- Extract common patterns and reduce duplication\n- Establish clear architectural boundaries\n\n**Option B: Documentation & Onboarding Focus**\n- Create comprehensive system documentation\n- Build interactive tutorials for the debate system\n- Document all APIs, especially for the plugin system\n- Create architectural decision records (ADRs)\n\n**Option C: Security Audit & Hardening**\n- Conduct thorough security review\n- Implement input validation across all endpoints\n- Add rate limiting and abuse prevention\n- Secure the plugin system against malicious code\n\n**Option D: Observability & Monitoring Implementation**\n- Add comprehensive metrics collection\n- Implement distributed tracing\n- Create dashboards for system health\n- Set up alerting for anomalies\n\n### 3.
