PROBLEMS AND RISKS\n\n**Immediate Risks:**\n- **Time Investment**: Building a comprehensive test suite for 34 evolved features could take weeks\n- **False Confidence**: Poor tests might give illusion of safety while hiding bugs\n- **Performance Overhead**: Test execution could slow down development cycles\n- **Maintenance Burden**: Tests need updates whenever features change\n- **Scope Creep**: \"Comprehensive\" is vague - could lead to over-engineering\n\n**Deeper Concerns:**\n- If the same features keep being re-implemented (performance_optimization x3), the codebase might be fundamentally broken\n- Without understanding why features are duplicated, tests might just codify broken behavior\n- Test suite won't fix architectural issues that cause feature re-implementation\n\n### 2.
