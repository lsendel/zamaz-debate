This is best achieved by modularizing the code.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n*   **Code Quality & Maintainability:** A monolithic codebase quickly becomes unmanageable. Breaking the system into well-defined modules (e.g., argument parsing, evidence retrieval, scoring logic, UI elements) will drastically improve readability, testability, and maintainability as the system grows.\n*   **Future Evolutions:** Modularization enables easier implementation of future features and optimizations. Need to swap out the argument parser? A modular design makes that a localized change. Want to experiment with different scoring algorithms? Separate modules facilitate such experimentation.\n*   **Performance:** While outright performance optimization may not be the priority now, a well-structured codebase inherently tends to be more performant than a tangled mess. Modularization encourages cleaner code and reduces the likelihood of unnecessary dependencies or redundant calculations.\n*   **Usability:** While not directly impacting user-facing usability in the short term, improved code quality will make it easier to add features and fixes in the future that *will* improve usability.\n\nWhile functionality, performance, and usability improvements are important, addressing the underlying code structure early on will pay dividends as the project evolves. Focusing on modularization allows us to create a more robust and adaptable system for the long term, preventing future technical debt.\n",

Optimizing now is likely a waste of time.\n*   **Functionality is Secondary:** The user interface likely exposes existing functionality. Improving usability without stability is like putting lipstick on a pig.\n*   **Code Quality is Important, but Secondary to Stability:** While always important, refactoring for code quality is less critical than ensuring the system doesn't crash or produce incorrect results.\n*   **Robustness is Foundational:** With only one debate run, the system is likely fragile. Poor error handling will lead to frustrating user experiences and unreliable results. Identifying and handling potential errors (e.g., invalid input, unexpected API responses, network issues) will make the system more resilient and prepare it for wider testing and usage.
