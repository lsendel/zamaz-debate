Problem Identification\n\nLooking at the evolution history, I see several concerning patterns:\n\n**Pattern Problems:**\n- 79 out of 80 evolutions are \"features\" with only 1 \"enhancement\" - this suggests feature bloat without refinement\n- Recent \"performance_optimization\" appears 3 times in a row - indicating either failed implementations or poor tracking\n- The system has had 80 evolutions but is still at version 0.1.0 - suggesting none of these changes were significant enough to warrant even a minor version bump\n- Plugin architecture was added recently, but without corresponding enhancements to manage complexity\n\n**Potential System Risks:**\n- Technical debt accumulation from rapid feature addition\n- Performance degradation from layered features without optimization\n- User experience suffering from feature overload\n- System instability from inadequate testing of 80 features\n\n### 2. Alternative Approaches to Consider\n\n**Option A: Feature Freeze & Consolidation**\n- Stop adding new features entirely\n- Audit existing 80 features for actual usage\n- Remove or merge redundant features\n- Focus on making core features work excellently\n\n**Option B: Complete Architecture Rewrite**\n- Given 80 evolutions at v0.1.0, the foundation may be fundamentally flawed\n- Design a clean v1.0 architecture based on lessons learned\n- Implement only proven, essential features\n\n**Option C: Comprehensive Testing Framework**\n- Add integration, performance, and user acceptance testing\n- Ensure each of the 80 features actually works as intended\n- Create regression tests to prevent feature breakage\n\n**Option D: User Analytics & Feedback System**\n- Implement telemetry to understand which features are actually used\n- Add feedback mechanisms to understand user pain points\n- Make data-driven decisions about what to improve\n\n### 3. Trade-offs Analysis\n\n**Feature Freeze & Consolidation**\n- \u2705 Pros: Reduces complexity, improves stability, better user experience\n- \u274c Cons: May disappoint users expecting new features, requires difficult decisions about what to cut\n\n**Complete Architecture Rewrite**\n- \u2705 Pros: Clean slate, better foundation\n\nGemini's Analysis:\nGemini error: No module named 'openai'\n\nConsensus: Yes",
