Potential Problems and Risks with Common Proposals\n\nGiven the evolution history showing 9 feature additions (including 3 consecutive performance optimizations), the most obvious proposals would be:\n- More performance optimization (already overdone)\n- More features (risking feature bloat)\n- UI/UX improvements (premature without user feedback)\n\n**Key Risk**: The system appears to be in a feature accumulation phase without proper validation or quality assurance infrastructure.\n\n### 2. Alternative Approaches to Consider\n\n**Option A: Comprehensive Testing Framework**\n- Unit, integration, and end-to-end test suites\n- Automated regression testing for debates\n- Performance benchmarking suite\n\n**Option B: Observability and Monitoring System**\n- Logging infrastructure\n- Metrics collection\n- Error tracking and alerting\n- User behavior analytics\n\n**Option C: Code Refactoring and Technical Debt Reduction**\n- Modularize the codebase\n- Extract common patterns\n- Improve code documentation\n- Establish coding standards\n\n**Option D: Data Persistence and Versioning**\n- Proper database schema\n- Debate history tracking\n- Decision audit trails\n- Backup and recovery mechanisms\n\n### 3. Trade-offs Analysis\n\n**Testing Framework:**\n- \u2705 Pros: Prevents regressions, enables confident refactoring, improves reliability\n- \u274c Cons: Initial time investment, maintenance overhead, may slow initial development\n\n**Observability:**\n- \u2705 Pros: Real-world insights, proactive issue detection, performance validation\n- \u274c Cons: Infrastructure complexity, privacy considerations, analysis overhead\n\n**Refactoring:**\n- \u2705 Pros: Improved maintainability, easier future changes, better developer experience\n- \u274c Cons: No immediate user value, risk of introducing bugs, time investment\n\n**Data Persistence:**\n- \u2705 Pros: Enable historical analysis, support multi-session debates, data integrity\n- \u274c Cons: Schema migration complexity, storage costs, backup responsibilities\n\n### 4.
