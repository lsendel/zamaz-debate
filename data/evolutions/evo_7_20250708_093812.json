PROBLEMS AND RISKS WITH CONTINUING FEATURE ADDITIONS\n\n**Technical Debt Avalanche**\n- Adding a 7th feature on top of 6 rapidly implemented features (all on the same day!) suggests rushed implementation\n- No evidence of consolidation, optimization, or hardening phases\n- Risk of creating a \"house of cards\" architecture\n\n**Integration Complexity**\n- Each new feature increases integration points exponentially\n- Plugin architecture + caching + logging + API + testing framework = high coupling risk\n- Potential for cascading failures across subsystems\n\n**Performance Degradation**\n- No performance improvements in history suggests accumulating overhead\n- Caching system might be masking underlying performance issues\n- Each feature layer adds latency\n\n### 2. ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO CONSIDER\n\n**Option A: Performance Audit & Optimization**\n- Profile the system to identify bottlenecks\n- Optimize critical paths before they become blockers\n- Establish performance baselines and SLAs\n\n**Option B: Security Hardening**\n- Implement authentication/authorization for the API\n- Add input validation and sanitization\n- Establish security testing practices\n\n**Option C: Observability & Monitoring**\n- Implement comprehensive metrics collection\n- Add distributed tracing for debugging\n- Create operational dashboards\n\n**Option D: Code Quality & Refactoring**\n- Reduce coupling between recent features\n- Implement proper dependency injection\n- Standardize error handling across modules\n\n### 3. TRADE-OFF ANALYSIS\n\n**Continuing with Features**\n- \u2705 Pros: Visible progress, user-facing improvements\n- \u274c Cons: Technical debt, fragility, eventual development slowdown\n\n**Performance Optimization**\n- \u2705 Pros: Better user experience, scalability foundation\n- \u274c Cons: Less visible to stakeholders, requires measurement infrastructure\n\nGemini's Analysis:\nGemini error: 429 You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.
