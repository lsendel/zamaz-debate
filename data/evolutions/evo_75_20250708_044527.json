PROBLEMS AND RISKS WITH CURRENT STATE\n\nLooking at the evolution history, I see several concerning patterns:\n\n**Over-Engineering Risk**: 74 evolutions with 73 being \"features\" suggests feature creep. The system has accumulated logging, plugins, performance optimization (twice!), and metrics tracking - but we have no evidence these were actually needed.\n\n**Redundancy Issues**: Performance optimization appears twice in recent evolutions, indicating either poor tracking or redundant work.\n\n**Missing Fundamentals**: Despite 58 debates run, there's no mention of:\n- Error handling/recovery mechanisms\n- Data persistence strategy\n- Security considerations\n- Testing infrastructure\n- API versioning\n\n### 2. ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO CONSIDER\n\n**Option A: Consolidation & Cleanup**\n- Audit existing features for actual usage\n- Remove redundant code\n- Refactor duplicated logic\n- Document what exists properly\n\n**Option B: Robustness Layer**\n- Add comprehensive error handling\n- Implement retry mechanisms\n- Create fallback strategies\n- Add circuit breakers\n\n**Option C: Testing Infrastructure**\n- Unit test coverage\n- Integration test suite\n- Performance benchmarks\n- Regression testing\n\n**Option D: Data Management**\n- Implement proper persistence layer\n- Add backup/restore capabilities\n- Version control for debate history\n- Data validation layer\n\n### 3.
