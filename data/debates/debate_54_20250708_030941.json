ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES\n\nInstead of adding another feature, consider:\n\n**Option A: Technical Debt Sprint**\n- Audit the codebase for redundancy (especially those triple metrics implementations)\n- Implement proper error boundaries\n- Add comprehensive logging\n- Refactor for maintainability\n\n**Option B: Reliability Engineering**\n- Add circuit breakers for external dependencies\n- Implement graceful degradation\n- Create fallback mechanisms\n- Add health checks and monitoring\n\n**Option C: Development Process Overhaul**\n- Fix the deployment pipeline that allowed triple implementation\n- Add pre-commit hooks and integration tests\n- Implement feature flags for safer rollouts\n- Create a proper branching strategy\n\n## 3.
