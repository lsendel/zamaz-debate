With 0 debates run and 0 decisions made, this appears to be a system that hasn't been used in production yet.\n\n## Critical Analysis\n\n### 1. Potential Problems with Current State\n\nThe most glaring issue is that we have a debate system with multiple performance optimizations and advanced features (caching, plugins) but **zero actual usage**. This suggests we're potentially over-engineering a system before understanding real user needs. The key risks I see:\n\n- **Premature optimization**: We've already done performance optimization twice without any usage data\n- **Feature bloat**: Adding plugins and caching before basic functionality is proven\n- **No feedback loop**: With zero debates run, we have no idea if the core functionality even works well\n- **Missing fundamentals**: No mention of logging, monitoring, or error handling systems\n\n### 2. Alternative Approaches to Consider\n\nInstead of adding more features, we should consider:\n\n**A. Observability Infrastructure**\n- Add comprehensive logging and monitoring\n- Implement error tracking and alerting\n- Create dashboards for system health\n\n**B. User Experience Fundamentals**\n- Build a simple, intuitive UI\n- Add user onboarding/tutorials\n- Implement basic authentication\n\n**C. Core Debate Improvements**\n- Enhance argument quality validation\n- Add debate summarization features\n- Implement voting/consensus mechanisms\n\n### 3. Trade-offs Analysis\n\n**Observability Infrastructure:**\n- \u2705 Pros: Essential for production systems, helps identify real issues, enables data-driven decisions\n- \u274c Cons: Not directly user-facing, requires ongoing maintenance, adds complexity\n\n**User Experience:**\n- \u2705 Pros: Directly impacts adoption, reduces friction, makes system accessible\n- \u274c Cons: May require design expertise, could delay core feature development\n\n**Core Debate Features:**\n- \u2705 Pros: Enhances primary value proposition, differentiates the system\n- \u274c Cons: May add complexity before basics are proven, could be wrong without user feedback\n\n### 4.
