Potential Problems and Risks\n\nLooking at the evolution history, I see a concerning pattern:\n- 67 evolutions but still at version 0.1.0\n- Recent evolutions show duplicates (performance_optimization appears twice, metrics_tracking appears twice)\n- No \"bugfix\" or \"refactor\" evolution types - only features and 1 enhancement\n- The rapid feature accumulation without version increments suggests technical debt\n\n**Key Risk**: The system appears to be suffering from feature creep without proper consolidation or stability improvements.\n\n### 2. Alternative Approaches to Consider\n\nGiven the context, here are the top alternatives:\n\n**A. Architecture Refactoring & Modularization**\n- Break down the monolithic debate system into microservices or well-defined modules\n- Establish clear boundaries between debate logic, metrics, testing, and performance components\n\n**B. Version Management & Release Pipeline**\n- Implement proper semantic versioning\n- Create a release management system that actually increments versions\n- Establish feature flags for gradual rollouts\n\n**C. Deduplication & Code Cleanup**\n- Remove duplicate implementations (those repeated evolutions suggest code duplication)\n- Consolidate overlapping features\n- Implement a proper abstraction layer\n\n**D. Error Handling & Resilience**\n- Add comprehensive error boundaries\n- Implement circuit breakers for external dependencies\n- Create fallback mechanisms for critical paths\n\n### 3. Trade-offs Analysis\n\n**Architecture Refactoring**\n- \u2705 Pros: Better maintainability, easier testing, clearer ownership\n- \u274c Cons: High effort, risk of breaking changes, requires team coordination\n\n**Version Management**\n- \u2705 Pros: Better tracking, rollback capability, clear progress indicators\n- \u274c Cons: Process overhead, requires discipline, may slow initial development\n\n**Deduplication**\n- \u2705 Pros: Reduced complexity, faster builds, easier debugging\n- \u274c Cons: Risk of breaking working features, requires deep system knowledge\n\n**Error Handling**\n- \u2705 Pros: Better user experience, system stability, easier troubleshooting\n- \u274c",
