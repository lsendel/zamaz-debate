This can become burdensome, especially if tests are poorly designed or lack sufficient abstraction, potentially leading to \"test paralysis\" where time and resources are excessively consumed keeping tests in sync with changes.\n\n   - **False Confidence:** Unit tests, if not well-designed, can provide a false sense of security, particularly if they test implementation details rather than actual behavior. This might lead to a perceived improvement in code quality that does not necessarily equate to real-world reliability or bug prevention.\n\n   - **Complex Legacy Code:** For projects with a tangled or poorly understood legacy codebase, introducing unit tests might necessitate significant refactoring. This can be risky and lead to new bugs if not managed carefully.\n\n2. **Prerequisites or Conditions that Must be Met:**\n\n   - **Clear Testing Strategy:** A well-defined testing strategy is essential. This includes guidelines on what constitutes a \"critical module\" and the level of test coverage desired. It should also consider the balance between unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.\n\n   - **Team Skill Set and Mindset:** Developers must be proficient in writing effective unit tests and adopt a mindset that values testing.

The prerequisites of having a robust testing strategy, skilled team, and appropriate tooling are critical to success. Simplifying the approach with alternatives like code reviews, static analysis, and incremental testing might be more pragmatic initially. \n\nIf the organization has the funding, time, and a clear strategic mandate to improve code quality from long-term perspectives, implementing comprehensive tests makes sense.
