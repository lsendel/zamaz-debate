Technical Debt Reduction Sprint**\n- Refactor the existing 61 features for maintainability\n- Consolidate duplicate functionality\n- Improve code organization and modularity\n\n**B. Observability and Monitoring Suite**\n- Add comprehensive metrics collection\n- Implement health checks and alerting\n- Create dashboards for system behavior analysis\n\n**C. Testing Framework Implementation**\n- Unit tests for existing features\n- Integration tests for debate workflows\n- Performance benchmarks to validate optimizations\n\n**D.
