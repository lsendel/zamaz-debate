Potential Problems and Risks\n\nLooking at the evolution history, I see a concerning pattern:\n- **All 15 evolutions are \"feature\" type** - no bug fixes, refactoring, or infrastructure improvements\n- **Recent focus heavily skewed toward performance** (3 out of 5 recent evolutions)\n- **No evidence of testing, documentation, or maintenance work**\n\nThis suggests potential technical debt accumulation and a \"feature factory\" mentality that could lead to:\n- Fragile codebase with hidden bugs\n- Poor maintainability as complexity grows\n- Difficult onboarding for new developers\n- Unreliable system behavior under edge cases\n\n### 2. Alternative Approaches to Consider\n\n**Option A: Comprehensive Testing Framework**\n- Unit tests for core debate logic\n- Integration tests for plugin architecture\n- Performance regression tests\n- End-to-end testing for debate workflows\n\n**Option B: Observability and Monitoring**\n- Structured logging for debate decisions\n- Metrics collection (decision time, participant engagement)\n- Error tracking and alerting\n- Debug mode for troubleshooting\n\n**Option C: Documentation and Developer Experience**\n- API documentation\n- Architecture decision records (ADRs)\n- Setup guides and tutorials\n- Code commenting standards\n\n**Option D: Security and Data Integrity**\n- Input validation for debate topics\n- Rate limiting for API endpoints\n- Audit trails for decisions\n- Data sanitization\n\n### 3. Trade-offs Analysis\n\n**Testing Framework**\n- \u2705 Pros: Prevents regressions, enables confident refactoring, improves reliability\n- \u274c Cons: Initial time investment, ongoing maintenance burden, can slow feature velocity\n\n**Observability**\n- \u2705 Pros: Real-time insights, faster debugging, data-driven improvements\n- \u274c Cons: Infrastructure complexity, potential performance overhead, privacy considerations\n\n**Documentation**\n- \u2705 Pros: Faster onboarding, reduced knowledge silos, better collaboration\n- \u274c Cons: Requires discipline to maintain, can become outdated, doesn't directly improve functionality\n\n**Security**\n- \u2705 Pros",
