Problems and Risks with Current State\n\nLooking at the evolution history, I see several concerning patterns:\n\n- **Evolution Monotony**: 30 features vs only 1 enhancement suggests a feature-bloat problem\n- **Repetitive Optimizations**: Four consecutive \"performance_optimization\" entries on the same date indicates either:\n  - Failed optimization attempts being retried\n  - Lack of proper performance metrics to validate improvements\n  - Copy-paste errors in the evolution tracking\n- **Missing Critical Aspects**: No evolutions for bug fixes, security patches, or refactoring\n- **Low Usage Rate**: Only 15 debates run with 15 decisions suggests each decision only gets one debate - no iteration or refinement\n\n### 2. Alternative Approaches to Consider\n\n**Option A: Comprehensive Testing Framework**\n- Add unit, integration, and performance tests\n- Implement debate replay capability for regression testing\n- Create benchmarks for decision quality metrics\n\n**Option B: Observability and Debugging**\n- Add detailed logging and tracing\n- Implement debate history visualization\n- Create decision audit trails with reasoning graphs\n\n**Option C: Code Refactoring and Debt Reduction**\n- Address the apparent duplication (4x performance_optimization)\n- Modularize the plugin architecture properly\n- Clean up technical debt before adding more features\n\n**Option D: User Experience Overhaul**\n- Implement debate templates for common scenarios\n- Add decision confidence scoring\n- Create feedback loops for decision outcomes\n\n### 3.
