PROBLEMS AND RISKS\n\nLooking at the evolution history, I see concerning patterns:\n\n**Duplication Issues:**\n- `logging_system` implemented twice on the same day\n- `performance_optimization` implemented twice on the same day\n- This suggests either:\n  - Poor version control/tracking\n  - Failed implementations requiring re-work\n  - Lack of proper testing before deployment\n\n**Evolution Imbalance:**\n- 136 features vs only 2 enhancements\n- This indicates potential technical debt accumulation\n- Features may be added without refining existing functionality\n\n**Missing Critical Components:**\n- No error handling improvements\n- No security enhancements\n- No data persistence/recovery mechanisms\n- No user authentication/authorization\n\n### 2. ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES\n\nInstead of adding another feature, consider these alternatives:\n\n**A. Technical Debt Reduction**\n- Audit and consolidate duplicate implementations\n- Refactor existing code for maintainability\n- Implement comprehensive testing suite\n\n**B. Reliability Infrastructure**\n- Add error boundaries and graceful degradation\n- Implement state persistence and recovery\n- Add health checks and monitoring\n\n**C. Security Hardening**\n- Input validation and sanitization\n- Rate limiting for debate submissions\n- Audit logging for decision tracking\n\n**D. User Experience Refinement**\n- Improve debate result visualization\n- Add decision history and analytics\n- Implement undo/redo functionality\n\n### 3. TRADE-OFFS ANALYSIS\n\n**Adding More Features (Status Quo)**\n- PROS: Increases system capabilities, attracts users\n- CONS: Increases complexity, technical debt, maintenance burden\n\n**Technical Debt Reduction**\n- PROS: Improves long-term maintainability, reduces bugs\n- CONS: No immediate user-visible benefits, requires time investment\n\n**Reliability Infrastructure**\n- PROS: Prevents data loss, improves user trust, reduces support burden\n- CONS: Complex to implement correctly, may impact performance\n\n**Security Hardening**\n- PROS: Protects against attacks, ensures data integrity\n- CONS: May add friction to user experience, requires ongoing maintenance\n\n### 4.
