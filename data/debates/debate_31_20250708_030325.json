Potential Problems and Risks with Common Proposals\n\nLooking at the evolution history, I see a concerning pattern: 45 features vs only 1 enhancement, with recent focus exclusively on performance optimization (5 consecutive times). This suggests:\n\n**Risk of Feature Bloat**: Adding yet another feature risks creating an overly complex system that's hard to maintain and use.\n\n**Performance Optimization Fatigue**: The repeated performance optimizations suggest either:\n- Previous optimizations weren't effective (indicating deeper architectural issues)\n- The team is stuck in premature optimization\n- Performance metrics aren't being properly measured\n\n**Missing Foundation**: With 30 debates run and version 0.1.0, the system appears to be in early stages but already accumulating features without solidifying core functionality.\n\n### 2. Alternative Approaches to Consider\n\nInstead of adding features or more performance tweaks, consider:\n\n**A. Architecture Refactoring**\n- Consolidate the 45 features into coherent modules\n- Establish clear boundaries and interfaces\n- Remove redundant or unused features\n\n**B. Comprehensive Testing Framework**\n- Unit tests for core debate logic\n- Integration tests for feature interactions\n- Performance benchmarks to validate optimization efforts\n\n**C. User Feedback Integration**\n- Analytics on which features are actually used\n- Usability studies on the debate interface\n- Error tracking and debugging tools\n\n**D. Documentation and Knowledge Management**\n- API documentation\n- Architecture decision records\n- User guides and best practices\n\n### 3. Trade-offs Analysis\n\n**Adding More Features:**\n- \u2705 Pros: Attracts users, competitive advantage\n- \u274c Cons: Technical debt, complexity, maintenance burden, learning curve\n\n**Performance Optimization (again):**\n- \u2705 Pros: Faster response times, scalability\n- \u274c Cons: Diminishing returns, premature optimization, ignoring other issues\n\n**Architecture Refactoring:**\n- \u2705 Pros: Long-term maintainability, easier feature additions, better performance\n- \u274c Cons: No immediate user-visible benefits, requires significant effort\n\n**Testing Framework:**\n- \u2705 Pros: Reliability, confidence",
