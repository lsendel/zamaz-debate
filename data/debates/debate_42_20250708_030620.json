Potential Problems and Risks\n\nLooking at the evolution history, I see several concerning patterns:\n\n**Risk 1: Feature Creep Without Foundation**\n- 56 features vs only 1 enhancement suggests rapid feature addition without consolidation\n- No evidence of refactoring, testing improvements, or architectural cleanup\n- This pattern typically leads to technical debt accumulation and system brittleness\n\n**Risk 2: Performance Optimization Repetition**\n- Three consecutive \"performance_optimization\" evolutions on the same date indicates either:\n  - Failed optimization attempts requiring multiple iterations\n  - Lack of proper performance metrics to validate improvements\n  - Band-aid solutions rather than addressing root causes\n\n**Risk 3: Missing Critical Infrastructure**\n- No mention of error handling, logging, or monitoring improvements\n- No security-related evolutions\n- No testing framework enhancements\n\n### 2. Alternative Approaches\n\n**Option A: Technical Debt Reduction**\n- Conduct a comprehensive code audit\n- Implement proper error boundaries and exception handling\n- Add comprehensive logging and monitoring\n- Refactor repeated code patterns\n\n**Option B: Testing Infrastructure**\n- Implement automated testing framework\n- Add integration tests for debate flows\n- Create performance benchmarks\n- Set up continuous integration\n\n**Option C: Data Persistence & Analytics**\n- Implement proper data storage (currently seems to be in-memory only)\n- Add analytics to understand usage patterns\n- Create backup and recovery mechanisms\n- Enable historical analysis of debates\n\n**Option D: Architecture Redesign**\n- Modularize the system into microservices\n- Implement proper separation of concerns\n- Add caching layers for performance\n- Create plugin architecture for extensibility\n\n### 3. Trade-offs Analysis\n\n**Technical Debt Reduction**\n- Pros: Improves maintainability, reduces bugs, makes future changes easier\n- Cons: No immediate user-visible benefits, requires significant time investment\n\n**Testing Infrastructure**\n- Pros: Prevents regressions, enables confident refactoring, improves reliability\n- Cons: Initial setup overhead, requires team training, slows initial development\n\n**Data Persistence & Analytics**\n- Pros: Enables learning from past debates, provides insights, prevents data",
