Problems and Risks with Current State\n\nLooking at the evolution history, I see several concerning patterns:\n\n- **Feature Bloat Risk**: 60 features added with only 1 enhancement - this suggests rapid feature addition without refinement\n- **Performance Optimization Repetition**: \"performance_optimization\" appears 3 times in recent evolutions, indicating either:\n  - Previous optimizations were ineffective\n  - No validation of performance improvements\n  - Lack of systematic performance benchmarking\n- **No Bug Fixes or Refactoring**: The absence of maintenance-type evolutions suggests technical debt accumulation\n- **Missing Core Functionality**: With 45 debates run, we lack evidence of:\n  - Data persistence/recovery\n  - Multi-user support\n  - Debate quality metrics\n  - Version control for debate outcomes\n\n### 2. Alternative Approaches\n\n**Option A: Architectural Refactoring**\n- Consolidate the 60+ features into coherent modules\n- Establish clear boundaries and interfaces\n- Implement dependency injection for better testability\n\n**Option B: Comprehensive Testing Framework**\n- Unit tests for core debate logic\n- Integration tests for feature interactions\n- Performance benchmarks to validate optimizations\n- End-to-end tests for user workflows\n\n**Option C: Data Management System**\n- Implement proper database schema\n- Add backup/restore capabilities\n- Enable debate history analysis\n- Support concurrent user sessions\n\n**Option D: Debate Quality Metrics**\n- Measure debate effectiveness\n- Track decision quality over time\n- Identify biased or circular arguments\n- Provide feedback loops for improvement\n\n### 3.
