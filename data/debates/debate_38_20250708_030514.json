Recent evolutions include performance optimization, API enhancement, metrics tracking, automated testing, and documentation. This suggests a system that has been rapidly adding features without much refinement.\n\n### Potential Problems with Common Next Steps\n\n**1. Adding More Features**\n- RISK: Feature bloat without addressing technical debt\n- RISK: Increasing complexity without stabilization\n- RISK: User confusion from too many options\n\n**2. UI/UX Overhaul**\n- RISK: Disrupting existing workflows\n- RISK: High effort with uncertain ROI\n- RISK: May not address core architectural issues\n\n**3. More Performance Optimization**\n- RISK: Premature optimization without understanding actual bottlenecks\n- RISK: May already be \"fast enough\" for current use cases\n\n### Alternative Approaches\n\n**Option A: Architecture Refactoring**\n- Focus on modularization and clean separation of concerns\n- Pros: Better maintainability, easier testing\n- Cons: No immediate user-visible benefits, requires significant effort\n\n**Option B: Error Handling & Resilience**\n- Implement comprehensive error boundaries and recovery mechanisms\n- Pros: Better user experience during failures\n- Cons: May not be the highest priority if system is stable\n\n**Option C: State Management Overhaul**\n- Implement proper state versioning and migration\n- Pros: Enables backward compatibility, safer updates\n- Cons: Complex to implement retroactively\n\n## Recommendation: **State Management & Versioning System**\n\n### Why This Is THE Most Important Improvement:\n\n1. **Critical Gap**: With 37 decisions made and continuous evolution, there's no indication of how state changes are managed between versions. This is a ticking time bomb.\n\n2. **Unique Problem**: Unlike the recent evolutions (performance, API, metrics, testing, docs), this addresses a fundamental architectural risk that grows worse over time.\n\n3. **Multiplier Effect**: Proper state management enables:\n   - Safe rollbacks when new features fail\n   - A",
