Potential Problems and Risks\n\nLooking at the evolution history, I see a concerning pattern:\n- 142 total evolutions with 140 being \"features\" and only 2 \"enhancements\"\n- Recent history shows 4 consecutive \"performance_optimization\" features\n- No bug fixes, refactoring, or maintenance work recorded\n- Version still at 0.1.0 despite 142 evolutions\n\nThis suggests several risks:\n- **Technical debt accumulation**: Adding features without refactoring\n- **Feature bloat**: System becoming overly complex\n- **Lack of stability focus**: No evidence of bug fixing or hardening\n- **Poor versioning practices**: 142 changes on v0.1.0 indicates no release discipline\n\n### 2. Alternative Approaches to Consider\n\nInstead of adding another feature, consider:\n\n**A. Technical Debt Reduction Sprint**\n- Refactor existing code for maintainability\n- Consolidate duplicate functionality\n- Improve test coverage\n\n**B. Stability and Reliability Focus**\n- Implement comprehensive error handling\n- Add system health checks and monitoring\n- Create automated testing suite\n\n**C. Architecture Documentation and Standards**\n- Document current system architecture\n- Establish coding standards\n- Create contribution guidelines\n\n**D. User Experience Audit**\n- Analyze actual usage patterns\n- Remove unused features\n- Simplify core workflows\n\n### 3. Trade-offs Analysis\n\n**Adding Another Feature:**\n- \u2705 Pros: Immediate new capability, user satisfaction\n- \u274c Cons: Increases complexity, more potential bugs, harder maintenance\n\n**Technical Debt Reduction:**\n- \u2705 Pros: Easier future development, fewer bugs, better performance\n- \u274c Cons: No visible user improvements, requires discipline\n\n**Stability Focus:**\n- \u2705 Pros: Better reliability, user trust, easier debugging\n- \u274c Cons: Time investment with no new functionality\n\n**Documentation:**\n- \u2705 Pros: Easier onboarding, consistent development, knowledge preservation\n- \u274c Cons: Perceived as \"non-productive\" work\n\n### 4.
