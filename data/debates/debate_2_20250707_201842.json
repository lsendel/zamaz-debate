  "question": "What should be the next major feature addition to the Zamaz Debate System to maximize its self-improvement capabilities?",
  "context": "Current features: basic debate between Claude and Gemini, JSON persistence, web API, simple complexity routing. Consider: versioning, rollback capabilities, automated testing of decisions, performance tracking, multi-agent debates beyond 2 AIs, or other innovations.",

      "claude": "The next major feature should be **performance tracking with outcome measurement**. \n\nThis foundational capability would enable the system to learn from its decisions by tracking metrics like decision quality, execution time, and downstream effects. Without measuring outcomes, the system cannot distinguish good decisions from bad ones, making genuine self-improvement impossible.\n\nKey components:\n- Track decision outcomes against predicted results\n- Log performance metrics (speed, resource usage, accuracy)\n- Create feedback loops to inform future debates\n- Build a historical dataset for pattern recognition\n\nThis feature unlocks future capabilities like automated testing, A/B decision comparison, and evidence-based routing improvements. Other features like versioning or multi-agent debates, while valuable, provide limited benefit without first establishing whether current decisions are actually good.\n\nPerformance tracking transforms the system from simply making decisions to actively learning which approaches work best in different contexts.",
      "gemini": "The next major feature addition should be **Automated Testing of Decisions (ATD)**. This will maximize Zamaz's self-improvement by providing quantifiable feedback on debate outcomes.\n\nReasoning:\n\n*   **Quantifiable Feedback Loop:** ATD allows for the creation of test cases with known optimal outcomes. By measuring how often Zamaz reaches these outcomes in debates, we gain a concrete metric for its performance. This allows for targeted improvements.\n*   **Facilitates Other Improvements:** ATD is a prerequisite for effective performance tracking and version rollback (testing performance before/after rollback). It enables data-driven decisions regarding model updates and strategy tweaks.\n*   **Directly Addresses Key Weakness:** Without objective testing, improvements are largely based on subjective assessment of debate quality. ATD adds much-needed rigor and focus.\n*   **Scalability:** Automated tests can be run at scale, providing statistically significant data for improvement.\n\nWhile other features like multi-agent debates and advanced versioning are valuable, they are best pursued after establishing a robust system for evaluating performance with ATD.\n"
