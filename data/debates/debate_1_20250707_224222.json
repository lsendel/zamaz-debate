Here's why:\n\n**Key benefits:**\n- **Catch regressions early** - Evolution tracking likely involves complex state management that could break with future changes\n- **Document expected behavior** - Tests serve as living documentation for how the module should work\n- **Enable confident refactoring** - With tests in place, you can improve the code without fear of breaking functionality\n- **Reduce debugging time** - Tests help pinpoint issues quickly rather than discovering them in production\n\n**Priority tests to add:**\n- Evolution trigger conditions\n- State transitions between evolution stages\n- Edge cases (invalid evolution paths, missing requirements)\n- Data persistence/retrieval\n\nStart with critical paths first, then expand coverage incrementally. Even basic test coverage is better than none, and you can build on it over time.",
