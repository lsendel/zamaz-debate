Alternative Approaches to Consider\n\n**Option A: Architectural Refactoring**\n- Consolidate the multiple performance optimizations into a coherent caching/optimization layer\n- Implement proper separation of concerns\n- Risk: Major breaking changes, requires significant testing\n\n**Option B: Reliability & Error Handling Framework**\n- Add comprehensive error handling, retry logic, and graceful degradation\n- Implement circuit breakers for external dependencies\n- Risk: May add latency, complexity in error scenarios\n\n**Option C: Security & Access Control Layer**\n- Implement authentication, authorization, and audit logging\n- Add input validation and sanitization\n- Risk: May impact performance, adds complexity for users\n\n**Option D: Data Persistence & Recovery**\n- Implement proper database layer with ACID compliance\n- Add backup and recovery mechanisms\n- Risk: Infrastructure complexity, potential performance impact\n\n### 3. Trade-offs Analysis\n\n**Continuing with Feature Development:**\n- \u2705 Pros: Quick wins, visible progress, user satisfaction\n- \u274c Cons: Technical debt, fragile system, harder to maintain\n\n**Focusing on Infrastructure/Architecture:**\n- \u2705 Pros: Long-term stability, easier maintenance, better performance\n- \u274c Cons: No immediate user-visible benefits, requires downtime\n\n**Security Implementation:**\n- \u2705 Pros: Protects",
