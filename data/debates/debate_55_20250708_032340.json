Potential Problems and Risks\n\nLooking at the evolution history, I see a concerning pattern:\n- **Excessive duplication**: \"metrics_tracking\" was implemented 3 times on the same day\n- **Feature-heavy development**: 69 features vs only 1 enhancement indicates a lack of refinement\n- **No bug fixes or refactoring**: The absence of these evolution types suggests technical debt accumulation\n- **Rapid feature addition**: 70 evolutions for a v0.1.0 system indicates potential instability\n\nThe biggest risk is **architectural rot** - the system likely has:\n- Duplicated code from repeated feature implementations\n- Inconsistent patterns across hastily added features\n- Poor integration between components\n- Accumulated technical debt making future changes expensive\n\n### 2. Alternative Approaches\n\nInstead of adding another feature, consider:\n\n**Option A: Architectural Refactoring**\n- Consolidate the triple metrics_tracking implementations\n- Extract common patterns from the 69 features\n- Establish clear architectural boundaries\n- Create a plugin/extension system for future features\n\n**Option B: Quality Gate Implementation**\n- Add automated code quality checks\n- Implement integration testing between features\n- Create performance benchmarks\n- Establish feature toggle system for safer rollouts\n\n**Option C: Documentation and Standardization**\n- Document existing architecture and decisions\n- Create coding standards and patterns\n- Build developer onboarding guides\n- Establish API contracts between components\n\n### 3.
