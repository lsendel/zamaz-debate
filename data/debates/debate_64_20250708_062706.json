Problems and Risks with Current State\n\nLooking at the evolution history, I see several concerning patterns:\n\n- **Performance Optimization Repetition**: The same \"performance_optimization\" feature appears 4 times on the same date, suggesting either:\n  - Failed implementations that needed rework\n  - Lack of proper testing before deployment\n  - Poor version control or evolution tracking\n  \n- **Feature-Heavy Evolution**: 78 features vs 1 enhancement indicates a system that's constantly adding new capabilities without refining existing ones. This typically leads to:\n  - Technical debt accumulation\n  - Increased complexity without proportional value\n  - Difficulty in maintaining code quality\n\n- **Missing Critical Elements**: No evolution mentions:\n  - Testing infrastructure\n  - Error handling\n  - Logging/monitoring\n  - Security improvements\n  - Documentation\n\n### 2. Alternative Approaches to Consider\n\n**Option A: Comprehensive Testing Framework**\n- Unit tests for debate logic\n- Integration tests for plugin architecture\n- Performance benchmarks to validate optimizations\n- Automated regression testing\n\n**Option B: Observability and Monitoring**\n- Structured logging for debate flows\n- Metrics collection (decision time, consensus patterns)\n- Error tracking and alerting\n- Performance profiling tools\n\n**Option C: Refactoring and Technical Debt Reduction**\n- Code complexity analysis\n- Dependency cleanup\n- Architecture documentation\n- API standardization\n\n**Option D: Security Hardening**\n- Input validation for debate content\n- Rate limiting for API endpoints\n- Authentication/authorization framework\n- Audit logging for decisions\n\n### 3.
