Potential Problems and Risks\n\nLooking at the evolution history, I see a concerning pattern:\n- 55 evolutions with 54 being \"features\" and only 1 \"enhancement\"\n- Recent evolutions show duplicate entries (performance_optimization appears twice)\n- The system appears to be in feature-bloat territory with minimal refinement\n- No bug fixes, refactoring, or architectural improvements listed\n\nKey risks with continuing this pattern:\n- **Technical debt accumulation**: Adding features without consolidation\n- **Complexity explosion**: Each new feature increases maintenance burden\n- **Integration nightmares**: Features may conflict or create unexpected interactions\n- **Performance degradation**: More features typically mean slower execution\n- **User experience deterioration**: Too many features can overwhelm users\n\n### 2. Alternative Approaches\n\nInstead of adding another feature, consider:\n\n**A. Architecture Refactoring**\n- Modularize the system to reduce coupling\n- Implement proper separation of concerns\n- Create a plugin architecture for future features\n\n**B. Consolidation Phase**\n- Merge overlapping functionalities\n- Remove rarely-used features\n- Simplify the user interface\n\n**C. Reliability Engineering**\n- Add comprehensive error handling\n- Implement circuit breakers for external dependencies\n- Create fallback mechanisms\n\n**D. Security Hardening**\n- Input validation and sanitization\n- Rate limiting to prevent abuse\n- Audit logging for compliance\n\n### 3.
