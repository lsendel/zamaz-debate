Problems and Risks Analysis\n\nLooking at the evolution history, I see a concerning pattern:\n- 54 total evolutions with 53 being \"features\" and only 1 \"enhancement\"\n- Recent additions include API enhancement, metrics, testing, documentation, and performance optimization\n- The system appears to be suffering from **feature bloat** without adequate refinement\n\nKey risks with continuing this pattern:\n- **Complexity explosion**: Adding features without consolidation leads to unmaintainable code\n- **Integration debt**: Each new feature increases the surface area for bugs and conflicts\n- **User confusion**: Too many features without proper organization overwhelms users\n- **Performance degradation**: Feature accumulation without architectural review creates bottlenecks\n\n## 2. Alternative Approaches\n\nInstead of adding another feature, consider these alternatives:\n\n**A. Architectural Refactoring**\n- Consolidate overlapping features\n- Establish clear module boundaries\n- Implement proper dependency injection\n\n**B. Feature Deprecation & Cleanup**\n- Audit existing features for actual usage\n- Remove or merge redundant functionality\n- Simplify the core workflow\n\n**C. State Management Overhaul**\n- Implement proper state persistence\n- Add rollback/recovery mechanisms\n- Create clear state transition rules\n\n**D. User Experience Redesign**\n- Simplify the debate flow\n- Create guided workflows\n- Implement progressive disclosure\n\n## 3. Trade-offs Analysis\n\n**Continuing with new features:**\n- \u2705 Pros: Exciting for developers, marketable, addresses specific use cases\n- \u274c Cons: Technical debt, maintenance nightmare, user overwhelm, performance issues\n\n**Architectural consolidation:**\n- \u2705 Pros: Improved maintainability, better performance, clearer codebase\n- \u274c Cons: No immediate visible benefits, requires significant effort, may break existing workflows\n\n## 4. Recommendation: Architectural Consolidation & State Management\n\nThe ONE most important improvement is to **implement a proper state management and persistence layer with architectural consolidation**.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1. **Critical Gap**: With 38 debates run, the system lacks proper state persistence and recovery",
