PROBLEMS AND RISKS with Common Proposals\n\nLooking at the evolution history, I see a concerning pattern:\n- **Performance optimization** appears 4 times in the last 5 evolutions\n- 36 out of 37 evolutions are \"features\" vs only 1 \"enhancement\"\n- The system appears to be in a feature-addition loop without consolidation\n\n**Key Risk**: Feature bloat and technical debt accumulation. Adding features without refactoring or consolidating existing functionality creates a fragile, hard-to-maintain system.\n\n### 2. ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES\n\nInstead of adding another feature, consider these alternatives:\n\n**A. Architecture Refactoring**\n- Consolidate the 36 features into coherent modules\n- Identify and eliminate redundant code paths\n- Establish clear boundaries between components\n\n**B. Debate Quality Metrics**\n- Focus on measuring debate effectiveness rather than just counting them\n- Track decision reversal rates, implementation success, and stakeholder satisfaction\n\n**C. State Management Overhaul**\n- With 21 decisions and debates, state management likely needs attention\n- Implement proper versioning and rollback capabilities\n\n**D. Documentation and Knowledge Base**\n- Create self-documenting debate patterns\n- Build a searchable repository of past decisions and their outcomes\n\n### 3. TRADE-OFF ANALYSIS\n\n**Adding Another Feature:**\n- \u2713 PRO: Immediate visible \"progress\"\n- \u2717 CON: Increases complexity without addressing underlying issues\n- \u2717 CON: Makes future maintenance harder\n- \u2717 CON: Performance optimizations become less effective\n\n**Architecture Refactoring:**\n- \u2713 PRO: Reduces technical debt\n- \u2713 PRO: Makes future features easier to implement\n- \u2717 CON: No immediate user-visible benefits\n- \u2717 CON: Requires significant effort with regression risk\n\n**Debate Quality Metrics:**\n- \u2713 PRO: Focuses on outcomes rather than outputs\n- \u2713 PRO: Provides data for better decision-making\n- \u2717 CON: Requires defining \"quality\" in measurable",
