Potential Problems and Risks with Common Proposals\n\nLooking at the evolution history, I see a concerning pattern: 62 features vs only 1 enhancement, with recent additions focusing on performance optimization, metrics tracking, and logging. This suggests the system might be suffering from **feature creep** without fundamental architectural improvements.\n\n**Common proposals and their risks:**\n- **More features**: Risk of increasing complexity without addressing core issues\n- **More performance optimization**: Diminishing returns if the architecture itself is flawed\n- **More metrics**: Analysis paralysis - measuring everything but improving nothing\n- **UI improvements**: Cosmetic changes that don't address structural problems\n\n### 2. Alternative Approaches to Consider\n\nGiven the system's maturity (47 debates, 63 evolutions), I see three fundamental alternatives:\n\n**A. Architectural Refactoring**\n- Extract core debate logic into a clean domain model\n- Implement proper separation of concerns\n- Remove technical debt accumulated from rapid feature addition\n\n**B. Test Coverage and Quality Gates**\n- Implement comprehensive test suite\n- Add mutation testing to ensure test quality\n- Create automated quality gates for future changes\n\n**C. System Resilience and Error Handling**\n- Add circuit breakers and fallback mechanisms\n- Implement proper error boundaries\n- Create graceful degradation paths\n\n### 3. Trade-offs Analysis\n\n**Architectural Refactoring:**\n- \u2705 Pros: Enables sustainable future development, reduces bugs, improves maintainability\n- \u274c Cons: High initial cost, potential for introducing regressions, no immediate user value\n\n**Test Coverage:**\n- \u2705 Pros: Prevents regressions, enables confident refactoring, documents behavior\n- \u274c Cons: Time investment, tests can become maintenance burden, false sense of security\n\n**System Resilience:**\n- \u2705 Pros: Immediate user value, prevents cascading failures, improves reliability\n- \u274c Cons: May mask underlying issues, complexity in implementation, performance overhead\n\n### 4. Recommendation: Comprehensive Test Coverage and Quality Gates\n\n**My recommendation**: Implement a comprehensive test coverage system with automated quality gates.\n\n**",
