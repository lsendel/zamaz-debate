Potential Problems and Risks with Common Proposals\n\nLooking at the evolution history, I notice a concerning pattern: 126 features vs only 2 enhancements, with recent additions focused on performance, metrics, APIs, and testing. The most obvious next steps might be:\n\n**If we continue adding features:**\n- **Feature Creep Risk**: With 126 features already, adding more could create an unmaintainable, bloated system\n- **Integration Complexity**: Each new feature increases the potential for conflicts and bugs\n- **User Overwhelm**: More features \u2260 better usability; it often means the opposite\n\n**If we focus on more performance optimization:**\n- **Premature Optimization**: Without usage data showing actual bottlenecks, we might optimize the wrong things\n- **Diminishing Returns**: Recent performance work might have already addressed the low-hanging fruit\n\n### 2. Alternative Approaches to Consider\n\n**Option A: Comprehensive Refactoring**\n- Consolidate the 126 features into coherent modules\n- Remove redundant or rarely-used features\n- Establish clear architectural boundaries\n\n**Option B: User Experience Overhaul**\n- Focus on the core debate workflow\n- Simplify the interface\n- Add contextual help and guidance\n\n**Option C: Decision Quality Enhancement**\n- Implement debate outcome tracking\n- Add decision reversal analysis\n- Create feedback loops for improving debate quality\n\n**Option D: System Stability and Reliability**\n- Add comprehensive error handling\n- Implement rollback capabilities\n- Create system health monitoring\n\n### 3. Trade-off Analysis\n\n**Feature Addition (Status Quo)**\n- \u2705 Pros: Satisfies feature requests, shows \"progress\"\n- \u274c Cons: Increases complexity, technical debt, maintenance burden\n\n**Refactoring Focus**\n- \u2705 Pros: Improves maintainability, reduces bugs, enables future growth\n- \u274c Cons: No visible user benefits, time-intensive, risk of breaking changes\n\n**UX Enhancement**\n- \u2705 Pros: Direct user benefit, could increase adoption, reduces support needs\n- \u274c Cons: Requires user research",
