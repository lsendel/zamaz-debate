This would include:\n\n- Real-time debate quality metrics (argument coherence, evidence usage, logical consistency)\n- Post-debate analytics dashboard showing participant performance trends\n- ML-based scoring model to identify high-quality vs low-quality arguments\n- Automated feedback generation for participants to improve their debate skills\n\nThis directly addresses the gap between having infrastructure ready and actually delivering value through high-quality debates.

Because the current system, despite having good infrastructure, lacks the core functionality it's supposed to provide: running debates. Until a rudimentary debate can be initiated and progressed (even with very basic argument input and resolution), the system remains fundamentally incomplete and unable to validate the utility of the existing features. Focusing on further internal improvements without a functioning core would be premature optimization.\n"
