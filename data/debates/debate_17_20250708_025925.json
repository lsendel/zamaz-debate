Alternative Approaches to Consider\n\n**Option A: Technical Debt Reduction Sprint**\n- Consolidate duplicate features\n- Add comprehensive test coverage\n- Refactor for maintainability\n\n**Option B: Observability and Monitoring System**\n- Add structured logging\n- Implement metrics collection\n- Create debugging interfaces\n\n**Option C: Data Persistence and Recovery**\n- Implement debate history storage\n- Add crash recovery\n- Enable decision rollback\n\n**Option D: Security and Access Control**\n- Add authentication layer\n- Implement authorization for decisions\n- Audit trail for all actions\n\n### 3. Trade-offs Analysis\n\n**Observability System:**\n- \u2705 Pros: Enables data-driven improvements, helps debug issues, provides usage insights\n- \u274c Cons: Adds complexity, requires storage infrastructure, may impact performance\n\n**Technical Debt Reduction:**\n- \u2705 Pros: Improves long-term velocity, reduces bugs, makes system more maintainable\n- \u274c Cons: No immediate user-visible value, requires discipline to complete\n\n**Data Persistence:**\n- \u2705 Pros: Prevents data loss, enables historical analysis, supports recovery\n- \u274c Cons: Requires storage design, adds complexity, potential privacy concerns\n\n**Security Layer:**\n- \u2705 Pros: Protects sensitive decisions, enables multi-user scenarios, provides audit trail\n- \u274c Cons: Adds friction",
