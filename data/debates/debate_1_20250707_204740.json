This is a standard REST API pattern that provides clear value:\n\n**Implementation approach:**\n- `GET /api/users/{id}/stats` follows RESTful conventions\n- Return JSON with relevant metrics (login count, last activity, etc.)\n- Include appropriate authentication/authorization\n- Consider caching for performance if stats are expensive to calculate\n\n**Key considerations:**\n- Define which metrics to include based on actual user needs\n- Ensure response time is acceptable (<200ms ideally)\n- Document the endpoint schema clearly\n- Add rate limiting if needed to prevent abuse\n\nThis is a low-risk, high-value addition that extends your API naturally.",

Adding the `/api/users/{id}/stats` endpoint provides a structured and standardized way to access this data, improving data accessibility and potentially simplifying future integrations or reporting needs. The \"straightforward implementation task\" aspect further supports a positive decision.\n"
