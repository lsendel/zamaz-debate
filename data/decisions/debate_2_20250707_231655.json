  "question": "Should we implement a simple logging system for debugging?",
  "context": "To help track decision flow and debug issues",
  "decision_text": "Claude suggests: Yes, implement a simple logging system. Here's why:\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Track decision paths and identify where logic fails\n- Monitor performance bottlenecks\n- Capture edge cases and unexpected inputs\n- Enable debugging in production without code changes\n- Create audit trails for critical operations\n\n**Keep it simple:**\n- Use log levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG)\n- Include timestamps and context (function names, key variables)\n- Make it toggleable via environment variables\n- Consider structured logging (JSON) for easier parsing\n\n**Quick implementation approach:**\n```python\nimport logging\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n```\n\nThis minimal investment pays dividends in reduced debugging time and improved system understanding. Just ensure sensitive data isn't logged and implement log rotation to manage disk space.\n\nGemini suggests: Yes, a simple logging system is highly recommended for debugging. It significantly aids in tracking decision flow and identifying the root cause of issues by providing a record of events and variable states during execution. Even a basic implementation can dramatically improve debugging efficiency.\n",
