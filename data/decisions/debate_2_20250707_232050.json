  "decision_text": "Claude suggests: Looking at the evolution history, I see that the system has focused entirely on features (UI, API, logging, testing, caching) but hasn't addressed a critical foundation: **error handling and resilience**.\n\nThe ONE most important improvement is to implement **comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation**. \n\nHere's why this is critical now:\n\n1. **Code Quality**: Without proper error boundaries, one failed API call or unexpected input can crash the entire debate system. This makes the codebase fragile despite having tests.\n\n2. **Functionality**: The system needs to handle edge cases like:\n   - API rate limits or timeouts\n   - Malformed debate inputs\n   - Partial failures in multi-agent debates\n   - Cache corruption or unavailability\n\n3. **Performance**: Poor error handling leads to cascading failures and unnecessary retries, degrading performance under real-world conditions.\n\n4. **Usability**: Users need clear, actionable error messages instead of stack traces. The system should degrade gracefully (e.g., continue debate with fewer agents if one fails).\n\nThis improvement is foundational - it makes all the existing features more robust and reliable. It's the difference between a prototype and a production-ready system.\n\nGemini suggests: Given the project's very early stage (v0.1.0, 1 debate run) and the recent focus solely on features (UI, API, Logging, Testing, Caching), the most important improvement is **code quality**.\n\nReasoning:\n\nWhile new features are tempting, a solid foundation is critical for long-term maintainability and scalability. A single debate run isn't enough to expose underlying code quality issues that will inevitably surface as the system grows. Investing in refactoring, code reviews, and static analysis *before* adding more features will prevent technical debt from accumulating and making future development significantly harder.  Focusing on code quality now provides a stable base for further functional expansion and performance optimizations later.\n",
