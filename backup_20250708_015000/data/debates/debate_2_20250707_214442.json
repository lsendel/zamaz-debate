Optimizing now is likely a waste of time.\n*   **Functionality is Secondary:** The user interface likely exposes existing functionality. Improving usability without stability is like putting lipstick on a pig.\n*   **Code Quality is Important, but Secondary to Stability:** While always important, refactoring for code quality is less critical than ensuring the system doesn't crash or produce incorrect results.\n*   **Robustness is Foundational:** With only one debate run, the system is likely fragile. Poor error handling will lead to frustrating user experiences and unreliable results. Identifying and handling potential errors (e.g., invalid input, unexpected API responses, network issues) will make the system more resilient and prepare it for wider testing and usage. It will also expose areas for further development of edge cases.\n\nTherefore, focusing on robustness and error handling will build a solid foundation upon which to build further features, optimize performance, and improve the user interface.\n"
