The most critical need now is visibility into how these components interact in production. A monitoring system would:\n\n1. **Performance**: Track response times, API latency, cache hit rates, and identify bottlenecks across the entire debate pipeline\n2. **Reliability**: Set up alerts for failures, error rates, and system degradation before users notice issues\n3. **Debugging**: Correlate logs with metrics to quickly diagnose problems across distributed components\n4. **Optimization**: Provide data-driven insights on which debates/models consume the most resources\n\n**Implementation focus:**\n- Add OpenTelemetry instrumentation for distributed tracing\n- Implement Prometheus metrics for system health (CPU, memory, debate queue length)\n- Create a Grafana dashboard showing debate performance metrics\n- Set up alerting for critical thresholds (e.g., debate processing time > 30s)\n\nThis evolution is distinct from the logging system (which captures events) by focusing on real-time metrics, trends, and proactive issue detection. It's the natural next step to ensure the system remains performant and reliable as usage scales.",

This will involve profiling the system, identifying bottlenecks, and implementing targeted optimizations, potentially including database tuning, algorithm improvements, and resource management.\n"
