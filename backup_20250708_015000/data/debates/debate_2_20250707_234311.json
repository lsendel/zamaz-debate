Here's why:\n\n**Security Benefits:**\n- Prevents SQL injection, XSS, and other injection attacks\n- Blocks malformed requests that could crash your application\n- Reduces attack surface by rejecting unexpected data types/formats\n\n**Data Integrity:**\n- Ensures only properly formatted data enters your system\n- Maintains database consistency\n- Prevents corrupt or incomplete records\n\n**Better User Experience:**\n- Provides immediate, clear feedback on errors\n- Reduces debugging time for API consumers\n- Prevents silent failures downstream\n\n**Performance:**\n- Catches bad requests early, saving processing resources\n- Reduces unnecessary database queries\n- Prevents expensive operations on invalid data\n\n**Best Practices:**\n- Validate data type, format, length, and range\n- Use schema validation libraries (e.g., Joi, Yup, JSON Schema)\n- Implement validation at multiple layers (client, API, database)\n- Return descriptive error messages with proper HTTP status codes\n\nInput validation is a fundamental security practice and should be implemented for all public-facing APIs without exception.",
