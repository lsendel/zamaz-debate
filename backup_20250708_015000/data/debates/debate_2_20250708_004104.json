Potential Problems and Risks\n\n**Immediate Risks:**\n- **Authentication Downtime**: Any bugs introduced during refactoring could lock users out of the system, causing severe business impact\n- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Authentication is a critical security boundary - refactoring could inadvertently introduce auth bypass bugs, token handling issues, or session management flaws\n- **Breaking Changes**: Existing integrations, APIs, and dependent services might break if interfaces change\n- **Regression Issues**: Edge cases in authentication logic (password reset flows, 2FA, OAuth, etc.) might be missed in testing\n\n**Hidden Complexity Risks:**\n- **Undocumented Business Logic**: The \"complexity\" might actually be necessary business rules accumulated over years\n- **Integration Dependencies**: Authentication often touches logging, audit trails, user profiles, permissions systems, and external identity providers\n- **Performance Impact**: New abstractions might add latency to every single request in the system\n- **Migration Complexity**: How do we handle active sessions, remember-me tokens, and in-flight authentication requests during deployment?\n\n### 2. Alternative Approaches\n\n**Option A: Incremental Improvement**\n- Extract duplicated code into shared utilities without touching core logic\n- Add comprehensive tests to existing code first\n- Document current behavior before any changes\n- Gradually improve one subsystem at a time\n\n**Option B: Strangler Fig Pattern**\n- Build new authentication module alongside the old one\n- Gradually migrate traffic using feature flags\n- Maintain both systems temporarily\n- Lower risk but higher operational complexity\n\n**Option C: Third-Party Solution**\n- Adopt Auth0, Okta, AWS Cognito, or similar\n- Offload complexity to specialists\n- May require significant integration work\n- Potential vendor lock-in and cost implications\n\n**Option D: Status Quo + Documentation**\n- Accept current complexity as necessary\n- Focus on comprehensive documentation\n- Add monitoring and alerting\n- Train team on current architecture\n\n### 3. Trade-offs Analysis\n\n**Pros of Refactoring:**\n- Reduced code duplication \u2192 easier maintenance\n- Cleaner architecture \u2192 faster feature development\n- Better testability \u2192 fewer bugs\n- Improved developer experience \u2192 higher productivity",
