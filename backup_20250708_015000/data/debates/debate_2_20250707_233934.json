      "gemini": "Given the very early stage (v0.1.0, 1 debate run) and recent focus on internal features (UI, API, logging, testing, caching), the single most important improvement is **robust error handling and reporting.**\n\nReasoning:\n\n*   **Early Stage Fragility:** At v0.1.0, the system is likely fragile. Unexpected inputs, network issues, or logical errors within the debate engine are highly probable.\n*   **Diagnostic Bottleneck:** Without good error handling, debugging and improving the system will be severely hampered. A single debate run likely revealed some pain points, but comprehensive insights require knowing *why* things failed.\n*   **Foundation for Future Development:** Robust error handling provides a solid foundation. It helps identify bugs, guides development efforts, and ensures the system fails gracefully, preventing data loss and user frustration.\n*   **Prioritization:** Functionality, performance, and usability are less critical at this stage compared to knowing when, where, and why errors occur. The previous evolutions tackled internal improvements but not a critical error management system.\n"
