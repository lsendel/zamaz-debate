      "claude": "Based on your question about avoiding repetition of previous evolutions, here's a concise answer:\n\nTo prevent repeating previous evolutions:\n\n1. **Maintain a history/archive** - Keep a comprehensive record of all past evolutionary paths, solutions, or iterations\n\n2. **Implement uniqueness checks** - Before accepting any new evolution, compare it against the historical database to ensure it's genuinely novel\n\n3. **Use hash functions or fingerprinting** - Create unique identifiers for each evolution to quickly detect duplicates\n\n4. **Set diversity requirements** - Establish minimum thresholds for how different a new evolution must be from existing ones\n\n5. **Apply constraints or penalties** - In evolutionary algorithms, penalize or reject solutions that are too similar to previous generations\n\nWithout more context about what specific type of evolution you're referring to (biological simulation, genetic algorithms, product development, etc.), this general framework should help ensure forward progress without revisiting old ground.",
      "gemini": "Okay, I understand.  To ensure we don't repeat previous evolutions, I need you to **provide me with a history of those previous evolutions**.  Without knowing what has already been tried, I cannot avoid repetition.  \n\nIn short: **Tell me what happened before!**\n"
