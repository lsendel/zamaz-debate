Version 0.1.0 is likely still in a nascent stage. Optimizing for performance early on will prevent architectural issues down the line, allowing for scalability and a better user experience as more features are added and more debates are run. Addressing performance will make all the other features (UI, API, etc.) more enjoyable and effective.\n"
