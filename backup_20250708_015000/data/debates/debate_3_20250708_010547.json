POTENTIAL PROBLEMS AND RISKS\n\n**Performance & Speed Issues**\n- Security scans can significantly slow down CI/CD pipelines, especially comprehensive ones\n- This creates friction for developers who need quick feedback loops\n- May incentivize developers to bypass scans or batch commits to reduce wait times\n\n**False Positive Fatigue**\n- Automated scanners notorious for high false positive rates\n- Teams waste time investigating non-issues\n- Real vulnerabilities might get overlooked in the noise\n- Can lead to \"boy who cried wolf\" syndrome where warnings are ignored\n\n**Resource Constraints**\n- Security scanning tools can be expensive (licensing costs)\n- Require significant compute resources\n- Need dedicated personnel to configure, maintain, and interpret results\n- Integration complexity with existing CI/CD infrastructure\n\n**Limited Coverage**\n- Automated tools miss business logic vulnerabilities\n- Can't detect architectural security flaws\n- Won't catch runtime configuration issues\n- May create false sense of security\n\n## 2. ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES\n\n**Shift-Left Security**\n- IDE-integrated security plugins for immediate developer feedback\n- Pre-commit hooks for basic security checks\n- Security training and secure coding standards\n\n**Risk-Based Approach**\n- Manual security reviews for critical changes\n- Periodic penetration testing\n- Bug bounty programs\n- Focus automation only on high-risk components\n\n**Hybrid Model**\n- Fast, basic scans in CI with deeper scans scheduled separately\n- Security champions embedded in dev teams\n- Selective scanning based on change type/risk level\n\n## 3.
