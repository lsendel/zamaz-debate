Identifying Problems and Risks with Current State\n\nLooking at the evolution history, I see a concerning pattern:\n- **All 6 evolutions are \"feature\" type** - no refactoring, optimization, or bug fixes\n- Rapid feature additions (5 major features on the same day) suggests potential technical debt\n- No evidence of consolidation or integration testing between features\n- The system appears to be in a \"feature factory\" mode without addressing core quality\n\n**Key Risk**: The foundation may be unstable. Adding more features on top of potentially shaky implementations of logging, caching, and plugins could lead to:\n- Integration conflicts\n- Performance degradation\n- Maintenance nightmares\n- Security vulnerabilities\n\n### 2. Alternative Approaches to Consider\n\n**Option A: Feature Freeze & Stability Sprint**\n- Stop adding features temporarily\n- Focus on integration testing between existing components\n- Refactor overlapping functionality\n- Document the current architecture properly\n\n**Option B: Performance Optimization Phase**\n- Profile the system under load with all features enabled\n- Identify bottlenecks (especially with caching + logging + plugins all active)\n- Optimize critical paths\n- Add performance benchmarks\n\n**Option C: Security Hardening**\n- Audit the plugin architecture for vulnerabilities\n- Review API authentication/authorization\n- Implement rate limiting\n- Add input validation across all endpoints\n\n**Option D: User Experience Overhaul**\n- The system has grown complex with many features\n- Create a unified configuration system\n- Implement better error messages and recovery\n- Add operational dashboards\n\n### 3.
