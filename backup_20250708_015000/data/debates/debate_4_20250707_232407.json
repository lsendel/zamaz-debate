With only 3 debates run, performance issues might not be immediately apparent, but technical debt is likely accumulating. Refactoring and optimizing the existing codebase will:\n\n*   **Improve Code Quality:** Make the code more readable, maintainable, and testable, reducing the risk of future bugs and making it easier for developers to contribute.\n*   **Enhance Performance:** Identify and address performance bottlenecks, leading to faster debate processing and a more responsive system as the number of debates increases.\n*   **Enable Future Development:** A cleaner, more efficient codebase will make it easier to add new features and functionalities in the future without introducing significant technical debt.\n\nFocusing on refactoring now, before complexity spirals, is a preventative measure that will pay dividends in the long run. Delaying it will only make the task more difficult and costly later.\n"
