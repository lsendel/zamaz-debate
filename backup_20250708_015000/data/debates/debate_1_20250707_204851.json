      "claude": "Yes, absolutely. Unit tests are essential for this endpoint, especially given its security and data sensitivity implications.\n\n**Priority test cases:**\n- **Authentication**: Verify token validation, expired tokens, and unauthorized access attempts\n- **Authorization**: Ensure users can only access their own statistics (unless admin)\n- **Error handling**: Test database failures, invalid user IDs, and malformed requests\n- **Response validation**: Confirm correct data structure, field types, and calculation accuracy\n- **Edge cases**: Empty statistics, new users, and boundary conditions\n\n**Recommended approach:**\n- Use mocking for database calls to ensure fast, isolated tests\n- Include integration tests for critical paths\n- Aim for >80% code coverage\n- Add tests to CI/CD pipeline to catch regressions early\n\nThis investment in testing will pay off through reduced bugs, easier refactoring, and faster debugging when issues arise in production.",

They will validate authentication, handle error scenarios gracefully, and guarantee the response format conforms to the API specification.
