A proper error handling system will allow for graceful degradation, prevent crashes, and provide essential information for debugging. With only one debate run, we lack sufficient data on error scenarios.

Without good error handling, debugging becomes a nightmare.\n*   **Prioritization over other aspects:**\n    *   *Code Quality*: While important, error handling is more urgent at this stage, offering a safety net for potentially shaky initial code.\n    *   *Functionality*: Further features without addressing error handling is building on a potentially unstable base.\n    *   *Performance*: Premature optimization is the root of all evil. Focus on stability first.\n    *   *Usability*: Users won't be happy if the system crashes constantly, regardless of how polished the UI is.\n\nBy implementing a robust error handling system, we lay a solid foundation for future development, making the system more stable, maintainable, and debuggable.\n"
