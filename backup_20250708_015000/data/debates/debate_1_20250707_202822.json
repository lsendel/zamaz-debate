      "gemini": "For the Zamaz Debate System, implement a combination of **pytest** with the **hypothesis** and **snapshot testing** libraries.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n*   **pytest:** A mature, versatile, and widely used Python testing framework that is easy to learn and integrate. Its plugin ecosystem allows for easy extensibility.\n*   **Hypothesis (Property-Based Testing):** Essential for thoroughly testing the debate *logic* which likely involves complex rules and edge cases. Hypothesis generates a wide range of input data to uncover bugs that traditional unit tests might miss, ensuring decision quality across diverse debate scenarios.\n*   **Snapshot Testing (e.g., via `pytest-insta` or `snapshottest`):** Crucial for regression prevention, especially for evolution tracking. By capturing the \"expected\" outputs (e.g., debate outcomes, system states) after a change and comparing them to the results of future runs, we can quickly identify unintended side effects of modifications to the debate logic or tracking mechanisms. This satisfies the requirement to learn from past evolutions.\n*   **Avoids Repeating Past Suggestions:** Performance tracking is an orthogonal concern and can be addressed using separate tools (e.g., profiling, benchmarking suites) alongside this framework. This combination specifically tackles the lack of *automated testing* directly.\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n*   Robust testing of debate logic through property-based testing.\n*   Effective regression prevention via snapshot testing to monitor system evolution.\n*   Easy to integrate and learn, allowing developers to write and maintain tests efficiently.\n*   A comprehensive approach that addresses both decision quality and regression avoidance, the core requirement.\n"
