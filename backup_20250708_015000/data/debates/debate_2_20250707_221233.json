Before adding more features, ensuring the *core* functionality (running a debate) is performant is critical. Optimizing performance now will:\n\n*   **Identify bottlenecks early:** This early profiling and optimization will uncover inefficiencies before they are compounded by more features and usage.\n*   **Lay a solid foundation:** A performant core will make future development easier and less prone to performance regressions.\n*   **Improve user experience, despite a lack of usage so far:** Even with limited usage so far, slow performance will dissuade future use. Optimizing now, even prematurely, will ensure a better experience.\n*   **Diversify evolution types:** Shifting from pure feature additions to a performance-focused evolution will provide valuable experience with a different aspect of system development.\n"
