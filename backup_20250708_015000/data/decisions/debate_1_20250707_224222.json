  "question": "Should we add unit tests for the evolution tracker module?",
  "context": "The module currently has no test coverage.",
  "decision_text": "Claude suggests: Yes, you should add unit tests for the evolution tracker module. Here's why:\n\n**Key benefits:**\n- **Catch regressions early** - Evolution tracking likely involves complex state management that could break with future changes\n- **Document expected behavior** - Tests serve as living documentation for how the module should work\n- **Enable confident refactoring** - With tests in place, you can improve the code without fear of breaking functionality\n- **Reduce debugging time** - Tests help pinpoint issues quickly rather than discovering them in production\n\n**Priority tests to add:**\n- Evolution trigger conditions\n- State transitions between evolution stages\n- Edge cases (invalid evolution paths, missing requirements)\n- Data persistence/retrieval\n\nStart with critical paths first, then expand coverage incrementally. Even basic test coverage is better than none, and you can build on it over time.\n\nGemini suggests: Yes, absolutely. Adding unit tests to the evolution tracker module, especially since it has no current test coverage, is crucial. It will improve code quality, prevent regressions, and facilitate future development and maintenance.\n",
