  "question": "Should we implement a real-time WebSocket architecture for live debate updates?",
  "context": "The system currently uses HTTP polling. Consider performance, complexity, and user experience.",
  "decision_text": "Claude suggests: **Yes, implement WebSocket architecture, but with a measured approach.**\n\n**Key reasons to switch:**\n- **Performance**: WebSockets eliminate polling overhead, reducing server load by ~90% and bandwidth usage significantly\n- **User Experience**: True real-time updates (50-100ms latency vs 1-5 second polling intervals) create more engaging debates\n- **Scalability**: More efficient for high-concurrency scenarios common during active debates\n\n**Implementation strategy to manage complexity:**\n1. **Hybrid approach**: Keep HTTP endpoints as fallback for compatibility\n2. **Phased rollout**: Start with critical real-time features (vote counts, new arguments)\n3. **Use established libraries**: Socket.io or similar to handle reconnection, fallbacks, and edge cases\n\n**Considerations:**\n- Budget 2-3 weeks for implementation including testing\n- Ensure your hosting supports persistent connections\n- Add connection state management to your frontend\n- Implement proper error handling and reconnection logic\n\nThe improved user experience and reduced server costs typically justify the initial complexity investment, especially if you expect debates to have active concurrent users.\n\nGemini suggests: **Yes, switching to a real-time WebSocket architecture for live debate updates is highly recommended.**\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n*   **Performance:** WebSockets provide persistent, bidirectional communication, significantly reducing latency compared to HTTP polling, which repeatedly requests updates and consumes resources even when no changes occur. This leads to faster updates and reduced server load.\n*   **User Experience:**  Faster, more responsive updates translate to a smoother, more engaging user experience for viewers, making them feel more connected to the live debate.\n*   **Complexity:** While initial setup may be more complex than polling, WebSockets simplify the update logic on both the client and server long-term, leading to a cleaner and more maintainable codebase. Modern frameworks and libraries abstract much of the complexity.\n\n**In short: The improved performance and user experience offered by WebSockets outweigh the increased initial complexity, making it a superior solution for live debate updates.**\n",
