PROBLEMS AND RISKS\n\nLooking at the evolution history, I see several concerning patterns:\n\n**Pattern Problems:**\n- **Repetitive Evolution Types**: 18 features vs only 1 enhancement suggests a feature-bloat risk\n- **Duplicate Recent Evolutions**: \"performance_optimization\" appears 3 times and \"plugin_architecture\" appears 2 times in recent history, indicating potential:\n  - Failed implementations requiring re-attempts\n  - Lack of proper tracking/coordination\n  - Possible regression issues\n\n**System Maturity Risks:**\n- At version 0.1.0 with only 3 debates run, the system is barely tested\n- Adding complex features (plugins, performance optimizations) to an immature codebase is premature\n- No evidence of basic stability, error handling, or core functionality validation\n\n### 2. ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES\n\nInstead of adding another feature, consider:\n\n**A. Comprehensive Testing Framework**\n- Unit tests for existing functionality\n- Integration tests for debate workflows\n- Performance baselines before optimization\n- Error scenario coverage\n\n**B. Observability and Monitoring**\n- Logging infrastructure\n- Metrics collection\n- Debug tooling\n- Audit trails for decisions\n\n**C. Core Stability Improvements**\n- Error handling and recovery\n- Data validation\n- State management\n- Transaction safety\n\n**D. Documentation and Onboarding**\n- API documentation\n- Architecture decisions records (ADRs)\n- Setup guides\n- Contribution guidelines\n\n### 3. TRADE-OFFS ANALYSIS\n\n**Continuing Feature Development:**\n- \u2705 Pros: Exciting, visible progress, new capabilities\n- \u274c Cons: Technical debt accumulation, unstable foundation, maintenance nightmare\n\n**Focusing on Testing (Recommended):**\n- \u2705 Pros: \n  - Catches bugs early (3 debates is too small a sample)\n  - Enables confident refactoring\n  - Documents expected behavior\n  - Prevents regressions\n- \u274c Cons:\n  - Less visible to stakeholders\n  - Requires discipline\n  - Initial velocity decrease\n\n**Building Observability:**\n- \n\nGemini's Analysis:\nGemini error: No module named 'openai'\n\nConsensus: Yes",
