  "description": "Claude suggests: Claude error: 'function' object has no attribute 'create'\n\nGemini suggests: **Improve code quality through modularization.**\n\nGiven the current state (version 0.1.0, no debates run, small codebase), the single most impactful improvement is to focus on laying a solid foundation for future development. This is best achieved by modularizing the code.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n*   **Code Quality & Maintainability:** A monolithic codebase quickly becomes unmanageable. Breaking the system into well-defined modules (e.g., argument parsing, evidence retrieval, scoring logic, UI elements) will drastically improve readability, testability, and maintainability as the system grows.\n*   **Future Evolutions:** Modularization enables easier implementation of future features and optimizations. Need to swap out the argument parser? A modular design makes that a localized change. Want to experiment with different scoring algorithms? Separate modules facilitate such experimentation.\n*   **Performance:** While outright performance optimization may not be the priority now, a well-structured codebase inherently tends to be more performant than a tangled mess. Modularization encourages cleaner code and reduces the likelihood of unnecessary dependencies or redundant calculations.\n*   **Usability:** While not directly impacting user-facing usability in the short term, improved code quality will make it easier to add features and fixes in the future that *will* improve usability.\n\nWhile functionality, performance, and usability improvements are important, addressing the underlying code structure early on will pay dividends as the project evolves. Focusing on modularization allows us to create a more robust and adaptable system for the long term, preventing future technical debt.\n",
