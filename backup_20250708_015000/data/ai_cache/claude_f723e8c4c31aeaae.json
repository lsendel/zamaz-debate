By refactoring the core debate engine to use async/await patterns and enabling concurrent execution of agent responses, the system would:\n\n1. **Dramatically improve performance** - Multiple AI agents could generate responses simultaneously rather than sequentially\n2. **Enable real-time features** - Support live debates with streaming responses and dynamic participant joining\n3. **Scale better** - Handle multiple concurrent debates without blocking\n4. **Improve responsiveness** - The UI wouldn't freeze during long AI response generation\n\nThis architectural change would involve:\n- Converting the debate engine to async methods\n- Implementing proper concurrency controls (semaphores/queues)\n- Adding WebSocket support for real-time updates\n- Refactoring the storage layer for concurrent access\n\nThis is fundamentally different from the previous UI and API enhancements as it addresses the core architectural limitation that will become a bottleneck as the system grows. Without this change, adding more features will only compound the performance issues."}
