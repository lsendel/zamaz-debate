Errors are inevitable. Without robust error handling and logging, debugging and identifying bottlenecks will be extremely difficult.\n*   **Foundation for Future Development:**  Strong error handling lays the groundwork for stability and future enhancements. It prevents cascading failures and allows developers to quickly diagnose and address issues as the system is expanded.\n*   **Prioritization over Performance (at this stage):** While performance is important, premature optimization is a pitfall. Focus on stability and debuggability first. Performance tuning can be addressed *after* identifying performance bottlenecks through proper logging.\n*   **Alternative Considerations:** While code quality is important, the relatively small codebase suggests that a refactor would likely be less impactful than proactive error handling. Functionality and usability are less important because we don't know how to prioritize these improvements until we test the system.\n\nIn short, error handling and logging provide a crucial safety net and feedback loop that will allow for informed development and improvement in subsequent iterations.\n"}
